# How Much Does Outsourced Cold Email Cost?

Done-for-you cold email costs $1,800–$5,400/month depending on volume and channels. That includes infrastructure, deliverability management, copy, list building, and response handling. A single in-house SDR costs $6,250–$10,000/month fully loaded and takes 3–6 months to ramp. DIY tool stacks run $1,300–$2,300/month in software alone before you account for 15–20 hours/week of your time. Here's how every option compares on cost, speed, and cost per meeting.

## What Are the Three Cold Email Pricing Models?

The market has settled on three dominant pricing structures, and each one creates different incentives for the agency doing the work. Choosing the wrong model doesn't just cost more — it warps campaign quality.

<Tabs>

  <Tab title="Per-Lead Pricing ($50–$200/lead)">

    Per-lead agencies charge $50–$200 for each "lead" delivered. The problem is definitional: a lead could mean a reply, a positive reply, or just a name on a list — and the agency decides which. This model incentivizes volume over quality because the agency profits by generating the easiest-to-get responses rather than the highest-value prospects.

    The math exposes the misalignment. If an agency charges $100/lead and delivers 50 leads/month, you pay $5,000. If only 5 of those 50 leads are genuinely qualified (a 10% qualification rate, which is common in per-lead models), your real cost per qualified lead is $1,000 — not $100.

    Agencies using per-lead pricing often target low-hanging fruit — smaller companies with less sophisticated buying processes — because they convert faster. If your ideal customer is a VP at a mid-market SaaS company, a per-lead agency has a financial incentive to email office managers at 10-person firms instead. Some agencies also inflate lead counts by including auto-replies, out-of-office responses, or referrals that go nowhere.

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Per-Meeting Pricing ($200–$500/meeting)">

    Per-meeting pricing ($200–$500 per booked meeting, with enterprise targets running $500–$1,000) is a step up from per-lead because at least you're paying for a conversation. However, agencies on this model still cherry-pick the easiest targets. Mid-market accounts in familiar industries get prioritized; enterprise accounts with longer sales cycles and multiple stakeholders get deprioritized because the time-to-meeting is too long relative to the payout.

    Per-meeting agencies also require minimum monthly commitments of $2,500–$5,000 to cover base operational costs, so the "only pay for results" framing is misleading. You're paying a floor regardless.

    The deeper issue: per-meeting pricing detaches the agency from your pipeline. They book meetings — whether those meetings convert to revenue is your problem. There's no incentive to qualify hard or align targeting with your highest-value segments.

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Monthly Retainer ($1,800–$5,400/month)">

    Monthly retainer pricing — the model Outbound System uses — charges a flat fee that includes all infrastructure, copy, list building, A/B testing, response handling, and weekly reporting. No per-lead fees. No per-meeting surcharges. No software add-ons.

    This model aligns the agency with pipeline quality rather than vanity volume. Because the agency earns the same fee regardless of how many leads they "count," the incentive shifts toward generating meetings with decision-makers who actually match your ICP — the meetings that convert to revenue.

    Retainer pricing also enables long-term campaign optimization. Per-lead and per-meeting models push agencies toward short-term wins; retainers let the agency invest in deliverability infrastructure, multi-variant testing, and targeting refinement that compounds over months. The typical retainer range across the industry is $2,000–$15,000/month. Boutique agencies charge $2,500–$5,000. Mid-sized firms average $4,000–$10,000. Outbound System's all-inclusive retainer sits at $1,800–$5,400/month depending on volume and channel mix.

  </Tab>

</Tabs>

<Warning>

Avoid per-lead pricing. Agencies charging $50–$200 per "lead" have a structural incentive to deliver low-quality contacts and inflate counts. If your agency can't define exactly what constitutes a lead before the campaign starts — and that definition doesn't include ICP fit and decision-maker verification — the model will underperform.

</Warning>

## How Does Done-For-You Compare to DIY and Hiring an SDR?

The real comparison isn't just sticker price — it's total cost of ownership including time, ramp, infrastructure, and opportunity cost. Here's the full breakdown across all three approaches.

| Factor | DIY Tool Stack | Single In-House SDR | Done-For-You (Outbound System) |
|--------|---------------|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Monthly cost** | $1,300–$2,300 (tools only) | $6,250–$10,000 (fully loaded) | $1,800–$5,400 (all-inclusive) |
| **Your time required** | 15–20 hrs/week | 5–10 hrs/week managing | 1–2 hrs/week reviewing reports |
| **Time to first meetings** | 6–10 weeks (learning curve + warm-up) | 3–6 months (hiring + ramp) | 14 days |
| **Daily touchpoints** | 200–500 (limited by your capacity) | 50–80 (single person's bandwidth) | 5,000+ (managed infrastructure) |
| **Deliverability expertise** | You figure it out | SDR isn't a deliverability expert | Dedicated deliverability team |
| **Infrastructure included** | No — you build and manage it | Partial — you still buy tools | Yes — 350–700 inboxes, dedicated IPs, warm-up |
| **Ramp time** | Ongoing trial and error | 3–6 months to full productivity | None — proven system deployed in 14 days |
| **Annual cost** | $15,600–$27,600 + your time | $75,000–$120,000 fully loaded | $21,600–$64,800 |

### What Does a DIY Tool Stack Actually Cost?

Building your own cold email operation requires six to eight separate tools, each with its own subscription. Here's what the stack looks like at current market pricing.

Email sequencing platforms run $37–$97/month depending on volume — a flat-fee tool like Instantly charges $97/month for up to 100,000 emails with unlimited inboxes, while per-seat tools like Lemlist ($69/user/month with 3 sending emails) or Mailshake ($49/user/month with 2 email addresses) scale linearly with every inbox you add. At 50,000 emails/month, a flat-fee platform costs $97 versus $726–$792 on per-seat pricing — a 7.5–8.2x difference. At 100,000 emails/month, the gap widens to 14.5–15.8x.

On top of sequencing, you need email warm-up ($30–$50/inbox/month), a CRM ($50–$150/month), data enrichment ($100–$300/month), email verification ($50–$100/month), and 10–20 sending domains ($15–$25/domain/year plus $10–$20/month each for professional email hosting). Add it up and the tool stack alone runs $1,300–$2,300/month before a single hour of your time.

The tools are the smaller problem. The real cost is the 15–20 hours/week you spend managing campaigns, troubleshooting deliverability, writing and testing copy, building lists, and handling responses. At a founder's or senior marketer's effective hourly rate of $150–$300/hour, that's $9,000–$24,000/month in opportunity cost that never shows up on an invoice.

<Info>

The DIY tool stack runs $1,300–$2,300/month in software. But the 15–20 hours/week of management time, valued at senior-level rates, makes total cost $10,000–$26,000/month — more expensive than both a dedicated SDR and a done-for-you service.

</Info>

### What Does a Single SDR Actually Cost?

A single SDR's sticker salary ($50K–$70K base) masks the fully loaded cost. Add employer taxes and benefits (20–30% of base), tools and software ($200–$500/month), management overhead (your time recruiting, onboarding, coaching, and doing 1:1s), and workspace costs, and you reach $75K–$120K/year — or $6,250–$10,000/month.

The ramp problem compounds the cost. A new SDR takes 3–6 months to reach full productivity. During ramp, you're paying full salary for a fraction of output. If the hire doesn't work out (and SDR turnover averages 35% annually in B2B), you restart the clock on another 3–6 month ramp cycle while continuing to pay for the role. One bad hire can cost $40,000–$60,000 in wasted salary, recruiting fees, and lost pipeline before you even identify the problem.

A single SDR also maxes out at 50–80 touchpoints per day. A done-for-you service operating 350–700 inboxes executes 5,000+ touchpoints daily — 60–100x the volume of one human rep.

## What's Included in Outbound System's Pricing?

Every Outbound System retainer includes the full infrastructure and execution stack — nothing is itemized separately and there are no hidden add-ons. Here's what you get:

<Steps>

  <Step title="Azure Email Infrastructure (350–700 Managed Inboxes)">

    Dedicated sending infrastructure built on Microsoft Azure with 350–700 inboxes depending on your tier. Each inbox is warmed, authenticated (SPF, DKIM, DMARC), and rotated to maintain deliverability above 95%. Dedicated U.S. IP addresses ensure your sending reputation isn't shared with other clients. This infrastructure alone would cost $500–$1,500/month to build and $300–$800/month to maintain yourself, based on domain costs ($15–$25/year each across 10–20 domains), professional email hosting ($10–$20/month per domain), and warm-up services ($30–$50/inbox/month).

  </Step>

  <Step title="Domain Warm-Up and Deliverability Management">

    New domains go through a structured warm-up sequence before any cold outreach begins. Ongoing deliverability monitoring checks 100+ blacklist databases daily, manages sender reputation across all inboxes, and handles delisting if issues arise. Compliance with CAN-SPAM, GDPR, and CCPA is built into every campaign — regulations that add 15–20% to base operational costs when managed separately. Agencies that don't include deliverability management charge $200–$500/hour for troubleshooting when problems occur.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Prospect List Building and Verification">

    ICP-matched prospect lists built using 3–7 data sources with 95%+ email verification accuracy. Includes firmographic, technographic, and intent data enrichment. Professional list building costs $0.50–$2.50 per contact when purchased separately; automated verification adds $0.02–$0.05 per email address, and manual verification for high-value enterprise prospects costs $0.25+ per contact. Targeting C-suite executives at large companies requires an average of 47 minutes of research per prospect compared to 8 minutes for mid-market managers — that labor cost is absorbed in the retainer.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Copy Creation and A/B Testing">

    Eight to twelve initial email templates per campaign including first-touch messages, follow-up sequences, breakup emails, and re-engagement campaigns. Ongoing A/B testing optimizes subject lines, opening hooks, CTAs, and sequence timing. Each variant is tested against a statistically significant sample before winners are scaled. Campaign strategists and copywriters on the open market bill $200–$500/hour — this expertise is included, not billed separately.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Response Handling and Meeting Booking">

    Every positive response is handled within minutes during business hours, with qualification conversations and calendar coordination managed by the team. The average qualification interaction takes 23 minutes per positive response — including multi-touch engagement, BANT verification, and scheduling. Rapid response (within 5–15 minutes) dramatically increases meeting booking rates compared to next-day follow-up. At a done-for-you service, this labor is included; handling responses yourself costs 23 minutes per interested prospect multiplied across dozens of monthly responses.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Weekly Reporting and Optimization">

    Weekly performance reports covering open rates, reply rates, positive response ratios, meeting booking rates, and pipeline contribution. Standard reporting tracks 15–25 key performance indicators; enterprise tiers incorporate 40–50 metrics with attribution modeling and revenue impact analysis. Campaign optimization is continuous — copy, targeting, and sending patterns are adjusted based on real-time data, not monthly check-ins.

  </Step>

</Steps>

### What Should NOT Be Charged Separately

Watch for agencies that quote a low retainer then layer on fees that inflate your real cost by 30–50%. Three charges that reputable done-for-you services include in the retainer — and that should raise a red flag if they appear as add-ons:

**Software and tool fees.** Your agency should not pass through per-seat costs for sequencing platforms, warm-up tools, or CRM access. These are operational costs the agency absorbs as part of their service delivery. Agencies using per-seat tools see their internal costs scale linearly with inboxes — and some pass those costs directly to you. Expect $800–$2,000/month in undisclosed software expenses at agencies that aren't transparent about their tech stack.

**Setup fees.** One-time setup fees of $1,500–$5,000 are common across the agency market for domain configuration, authentication setup, warm-up sequences, and initial strategy development. The setup phase typically spans 2–4 weeks. A done-for-you service with a proven deployment process absorbs this into the retainer. If you're paying $3,600/month plus a $3,000 setup fee, your effective first-month cost is $6,600.

**Per-lead surcharges.** Any agency charging a monthly retainer plus per-lead fees is double-dipping. The retainer covers the work; the leads are the output of that work. Paying for both means you're subsidizing the agency's operations while also paying for results.

<Warning>

Hidden costs add 30–50% to base retainers at many agencies. Extra domains beyond the initial 3–5 included in base packages, data enrichment overages that exceed estimates by 200–300%, tool subscriptions, and warm-up services ($30–$50/inbox/month) can push a $4,000/month quote to $5,200–$6,000/month in practice. Demand a fully itemized cost breakdown before signing — and confirm which costs are truly included versus billed as add-ons.

</Warning>

## What's the ROI Math on Done-For-You Cold Email?

ROI on cold email is straightforward to calculate once you know your average deal size and the service's meeting output. The formula: ROI = (pipeline value – total cost) ÷ total cost. Track pipeline value using weighted probabilities based on your historical close rate.

<Info>

If your average deal is $10,000 and done-for-you generates 3 closed deals per month at a $3,600/month service cost, that's $30,000 in revenue on $3,600 in spend — a 733% ROI. Even at a conservative 1 deal/month, $10,000 revenue on $3,600 spend is 178% ROI. The breakeven point is closing roughly one deal every three months.

</Info>

Effective agencies generate 3–5 qualified meetings per $1,000 invested. Each meeting contributes $15,000–$50,000 in pipeline value depending on average contract size and close rate. Established businesses should target 3:1 returns minimum; growth-stage companies seeking aggressive expansion should aim for 5:1 returns. Across Outbound System's 44 documented case studies, the average ROI is 1,400% — driven by compound effects as campaigns optimize over 3–6 months and pipeline builds from sustained outreach. Any agency unable or unwilling to project specific meeting volumes and pipeline contributions likely lacks the performance data to justify their pricing.

### Cost Per Meeting Benchmarks

Cost per meeting varies by industry, deal size, and targeting complexity. Here are realistic benchmarks across common B2B segments:

| Segment | Typical Cost Per Meeting | Average Deal Size | Meetings to Break Even (at $3,600/mo) |
|---------|--------------------------|-------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Mid-market SaaS | $120–$250 | $15,000–$50,000 | 1–2 deals/quarter |
| Professional services | $200–$400 | $10,000–$30,000 | 1–2 deals/quarter |
| Enterprise software | $350–$600 | $50,000–$500,000 | 1 deal/quarter |
| Staffing and recruiting | $150–$300 | $8,000–$25,000 | 1–3 deals/quarter |
| Financial services | $250–$500 | $20,000–$100,000 | 1 deal/quarter |

Enterprise targeting commands higher cost per meeting ($350–$600) because complex organizational structures require significantly more research per prospect — agencies report spending 47 minutes of research per C-suite prospect at Fortune 500 companies versus 8 minutes for mid-market managers. But the deal sizes justify the cost: one enterprise close can return 10–50x the monthly service investment.

For comparison: an in-house SDR during their ramp period produces meetings at $800–$1,200 each (full monthly cost divided by low initial output). LinkedIn Ads average $500–$2,000 per B2B meeting, and Google Ads for B2B run $300–$1,500 depending on keyword competition. Done-for-you cold email consistently delivers the lowest cost per qualified meeting in B2B outbound.

## How Does Pricing Work Across the Cold Email Agency Market?

The broader agency market charges $2,000–$15,000/month depending on agency size and service scope. Boutique firms (under 10 employees) charge $2,500–$5,000/month and manage 5–15 clients simultaneously. Mid-sized agencies (10–50 employees) average $4,000–$10,000/month with broader service portfolios including multi-channel capabilities and dedicated account teams. Enterprise-focused agencies (50+ employees) command $8,000–$25,000/month for global infrastructure and strategic consulting alongside execution.

Most agencies also charge $1,500–$5,000 in one-time setup fees on top of monthly retainers, and the setup phase spans 2–4 weeks for domain configuration, authentication, warm-up sequences, and initial strategy.

The six pricing models you'll encounter across the market:

| Pricing Model | Typical Range | Best For | Watch Out For |
|---------------|--------------|----------|---------------|
| Monthly retainer | $2,000–$12,000/mo | Established businesses with consistent ICP | Scope creep — confirm what's included vs. add-on |
| Pay-per-lead | $200–$500/lead | Startups testing cold email as a channel | Low-quality lead definitions inflate counts |
| Pay-per-appointment | $500–$1,000/meeting | Teams that only want qualified conversations | Cherry-picking easy targets, minimum commitments of $2,500–$5,000 |
| Performance-based | $2,000–$4,000 base + 5–15% commission | High ACV businesses with short sales cycles | Enterprise deals may trigger 8–12% commission on $100K+ contracts |
| Hybrid (retainer + bonus) | $3,000–$5,000/mo + $250–$500/meeting | Scaling companies wanting aligned incentives | Complexity — ensure bonus criteria are clearly defined |
| Per-email | $0.10–$0.50/email | Businesses with verified lists needing execution only | Volume minimums of 2,000+ emails; personalization costs escalate fast |

<Tip>

When evaluating agencies, ask for a fully loaded monthly cost projection — not just the base retainer. Include all tool fees, data costs, domain expenses, and overage charges. Then divide by the projected meeting count to get your true cost per meeting. Compare that against the deal-size benchmarks above to determine if the ROI makes sense for your business.

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="Is cold email cheaper than hiring an SDR?">
    Yes — by a significant margin. A fully loaded SDR costs $6,250–$10,000/month ($75K–$120K/year including salary, benefits, tools, and management overhead) and takes 3–6 months to ramp to full productivity. Done-for-you cold email runs $1,800–$5,400/month all-inclusive and launches in 14 days. The SDR also maxes out at 50–80 touchpoints/day; a managed service executes 5,000+ touchpoints daily across 350–700 inboxes. The only scenario where an SDR wins on cost is at 18+ months when institutional knowledge compounds — but even then, SDR turnover (35% annually) frequently resets the clock.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do cold email agencies charge per lead or per month?">
    Both models exist. Per-lead agencies charge $50–$200 per lead, but this incentivizes volume over quality — agencies optimize for easy replies rather than qualified pipeline. Per-meeting agencies charge $200–$1,000 per booked appointment but tend to cherry-pick accessible targets. Monthly retainer models ($1,800–$5,400/month at Outbound System) include everything and align incentives on sustained pipeline growth rather than inflated lead counts. The retainer model produces more consistent, higher-quality results because the agency's revenue depends on keeping you as a long-term client, not hitting a short-term lead quota.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's included in a cold email retainer?">
    A full-stack retainer includes email infrastructure (350–700 managed inboxes with dedicated IPs), domain warm-up and deliverability management, prospect list building with 95%+ verification, copy creation with ongoing A/B testing across 8–12 initial variants, campaign automation and sending optimization, response handling and meeting booking, and weekly performance reporting. Nothing should be itemized separately. Watch for agencies that quote a low retainer then add fees for software, setup, domains, or data enrichment — these hidden costs add 30–50% to the real price.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How much does cold email infrastructure cost to build yourself?">
    Building and maintaining cold email infrastructure runs $800–$2,300/month depending on scale. That includes 10–20 sending domains ($15–$25/year each), professional email hosting ($10–$20/month per domain), warm-up services ($30–$50/inbox/month across 15–30 inboxes), authentication setup (SPF, DKIM, DMARC), blacklist monitoring, and deliverability tools. The bigger cost is expertise: when deliverability issues arise, agencies charge $200–$500/hour for troubleshooting, and a full-time deliverability specialist commands $100,000–$150,000/year in salary. Most businesses underestimate infrastructure costs by 40–60% because they don't account for ongoing maintenance and troubleshooting.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's a good cost per meeting for cold email?">
    Cost per meeting ranges from $120–$600 depending on industry and targeting complexity. Mid-market SaaS meetings typically cost $120–$250, professional services $200–$400, and enterprise software $350–$600. The key metric isn't cost per meeting in isolation — it's cost per meeting relative to deal size. A $400 meeting that leads to a $50,000 deal is far more efficient than a $120 meeting that leads to a $5,000 deal. Target a cost per meeting that's under 5% of your average deal size for healthy unit economics.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Are there setup fees for cold email services?">
    Many agencies charge $1,500–$5,000 in one-time setup fees for domain configuration, email authentication, warm-up sequences, and initial strategy development. The setup phase typically spans 2–4 weeks. Outbound System includes setup in the monthly retainer with no separate fee — campaigns go live within 14 days. If an agency charges both a setup fee and a monthly retainer, calculate your effective first-month cost (retainer + setup) and compare that against all-inclusive alternatives. A $4,000/month retainer with a $3,000 setup fee means your first month actually costs $7,000.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How quickly does cold email generate ROI?">
    With a done-for-you service, campaigns launch in 14 days and first meetings typically book within 30–45 days. ROI timeline depends on your sales cycle length and deal size. If your average deal closes in 30–60 days and is worth $10,000+, most businesses see positive ROI within 60–90 days. At $3,600/month service cost, you break even by closing roughly one $10,000 deal per quarter — anything beyond that is profit. Across Outbound System's 44 documented case studies, the average ROI is 1,400%, with most clients reaching payback within the first 45 days.

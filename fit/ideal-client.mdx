# Who We Work With

Outbound System delivers the strongest results for B2B companies selling solutions worth \$3K or more per deal, with proven product-market fit and a sales process that can handle 15-25 new qualified meetings per month. If you sell to other businesses, have reps who can close, and need more at-bats on their calendars — you are the client we built this system for.

## Ideal Client Criteria

Not every company is a fit for scaled outbound. The economics have to work, the market has to be large enough to sustain multi-channel outreach, and your team has to be ready to run a real sales process on the meetings we deliver. Here is exactly what we look for.

| Criteria                 | Threshold                                         | Why It Matters                                                                                           |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Business model           | B2B SaaS, AI, Tech, or Services                   | You sell to other businesses and your solution solves a clear, quantifiable problem for them             |
| Total addressable market | 1M+ contacts                                      | Your TAM must be large enough to sustain high-volume multi-channel outreach without exhausting your list |
| Customer lifetime value  | \$1K+                                             | The unit economics of your business must justify investing in outbound pipeline generation at scale      |
| Monthly revenue          | \$50K+/month with a working sales process         | You have reps who can close — you just need more qualified at-bats on their calendar                     |
| Product-market fit       | Validated offer, known ICP, existing proof points | You have case studies or results to back your pitch — outbound amplifies what already works              |
| Mindset                  | Growth-oriented, ready to move fast               | You want meetings on calendars in 14 days, not a 6-month "strategy engagement"                           |

<Info>
  The single strongest predictor of outbound success is customer lifetime value. Companies with \$15K+ LTV generate enough margin per closed deal to make the cost-per-meeting math work — typically producing 5-10x return on outbound investment.
</Info>

## When We Are Not the Right Fit

Transparency saves everyone time. We turn away clients who do not match these criteria because the results will not be there — and a failed engagement helps nobody.

| Disqualifier                                 | Why It Breaks the Model                                                                                      |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Small TAM (fewer than 10K contacts)          | High-volume outbound does not work when you can burn through your entire market in a week                    |
| Low LTV (under \$1K customer lifetime value) | The cost of outbound will not pencil out if each customer is worth less than \$1,000 over their lifetime     |
| No existing sales follow-up system           | We book the meetings, but if nobody shows up prepared to run a sales process, the pipeline dies              |
| Pre-product or pre-revenue stage             | Outbound amplifies what is working — if you are still validating your offer, it is too early for scale       |
| Inconsistent product or offer                | If your offer changes month-to-month, the messaging cannot be dialed in and results will suffer              |
| Need a 6-month pilot before committing       | Our clients move fast — if your buying process takes longer than our time-to-first-meeting, it will not work |

<Warning>
  If you do not have at least one person dedicated to following up on booked meetings within 24 hours, outbound will underperform regardless of how many meetings we generate. "Capacity to handle meetings" means a real human with a calendar, a CRM, and a process for running discovery calls.
</Warning>

## What "Capacity to Handle Meetings" Means Practically

This is the criteria most prospects underestimate. Booking 15-25 qualified meetings per month means your sales team needs three things in place before day one.

<Steps>
  <Step title="A dedicated closer or AE with open calendar slots">
    At minimum, one sales rep needs 20+ hours per month of availability for discovery calls. If your founder is the only person selling and they are also running product, operations, and fundraising, meetings will go unattended and show rates will collapse. The math: 20 meetings booked at a 70% show rate equals 14 conversations per month, each requiring 30-45 minutes plus follow-up.
  </Step>
  <Step title="A CRM or pipeline tracking system that is actually used">
    Every meeting we book gets logged. Your team needs a system — HubSpot, Salesforce, Pipedrive, even a well-structured spreadsheet — where those meetings are tracked through to close. Without this, you cannot measure ROI and we cannot optimize targeting. Companies without pipeline tracking typically see 40% lower conversion rates because leads fall through the cracks.
  </Step>
  <Step title="A follow-up process for no-shows and post-meeting nurture">
    Roughly 25-30% of booked meetings result in no-shows or reschedules. Your team needs a defined follow-up cadence — typically 3 touchpoints over 5 days — to recover those meetings. Companies with a documented no-show recovery process convert 60% of no-shows into rescheduled calls. Companies without one lose them permanently.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What Clients Need to Have Ready Before Starting

Beyond meeting capacity, the fastest-launching clients come prepared with four things that accelerate the first 14 days.

A **clear offer description** — not a features list, but a statement of what problem you solve, for whom, and what measurable outcome you deliver. This becomes the backbone of all outreach messaging.

A **defined ideal customer profile** — even a rough one. Industry, company size, job titles you sell to, and geographic focus. We refine this during onboarding, but starting with a hypothesis based on your best existing customers cuts research time by 50%.

**Proof points or case studies** — at least 2-3 results you can reference. These do not need to be polished marketing assets. A paragraph describing what you did for a client and what result they got is enough. Outreach with specific proof points generates 2-3x higher reply rates than outreach without them.

**Access to your calendar and scheduling tool** — Calendly, HubSpot meetings, or equivalent. We integrate directly so meetings land on your calendar without manual handoff, which eliminates the 48-hour lag that kills 35% of prospect interest.

<Tip>
  The single highest-leverage thing you can do before launch is write down your 3 best client results in this format: "[Client type] was struggling with [problem]. We [solution]. They achieved [specific metric] in [timeframe]." Hand us those three paragraphs and watch reply rates climb.
</Tip>

## How to Know If You Are Ready

The fastest way to evaluate fit is a 15-minute call where we walk through your ICP, deal economics, and current sales capacity. We will tell you directly whether outbound is the right channel for your stage — and if it is not, we will explain why and what to fix first.

Companies that match all six criteria in the table above typically see their first booked meetings within 14 days of launch and reach steady-state pipeline volume (15-25 meetings per month) by month two. Companies that match four or five criteria can still succeed, but the ramp takes longer and may require adjustments to their sales process in parallel.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What deal size do I need for outbound to make sense?">
    The floor is roughly $3K per deal, but outbound economics improve dramatically above $15K in customer lifetime value. At $3K deal size, you need a high close rate (north of 20%) to make the cost-per-meeting math work. At $15K+ LTV, even a 10% close rate produces strong ROI because each won deal covers months of outbound investment. Most of our highest-performing clients have average deal sizes between $15K and $150K.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Do I need a full sales team before starting?">
    No, but you need at least one person whose primary job includes running discovery calls and closing deals. That can be a founder, a single AE, or a small team — what matters is that someone has 20+ hours per month of calendar availability and a defined process for handling inbound meetings. We have launched successfully with solo founders who block mornings for sales calls and delegate the rest of their schedule.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What if I am pre-revenue or still validating my offer?">
    We recommend getting to \$50K/month in revenue and having at least 2-3 proof points before engaging an outbound agency. Outbound works by amplifying a validated message to a large audience — if the message is not validated yet, you will spend money learning what does not resonate instead of generating pipeline. Use early-stage channels (warm introductions, founder-led sales, content) to validate your ICP and offer, then bring in outbound to scale what works.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Which industries see the best results from outbound?">
    SaaS, financial services, and consulting firms consistently produce the highest reply rates and meeting volumes because their buyers are active on email and LinkedIn, their offers map to quantifiable outcomes, and their deal sizes justify the investment. Healthcare and manufacturing also perform well but require industry-specific compliance handling and longer decision cycles. See our [industries hub](/industries) for performance benchmarks by vertical.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How quickly can I expect results after signing up?">
    First meetings are typically booked within 14 days of launch. This includes 5-7 days of onboarding (ICP definition, messaging, infrastructure setup) and 7-10 days for initial sequences to generate replies. Steady-state volume of 15-25 meetings per month is usually reached by month two. Companies with a clear ICP and existing proof points reach steady-state faster than those requiring extensive discovery during onboarding.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What does Outbound System need from me to get started?">
    Four things: a clear description of what you sell and who you sell it to, 2-3 client results or case studies (even informal ones), access to your scheduling tool (Calendly, HubSpot, etc.), and a 60-minute onboarding call to align on ICP, messaging angles, and targeting criteria. Most clients complete all pre-launch prep within 5 business days. We handle everything else — domain setup, list building, copywriting, deliverability infrastructure, and campaign management.

# Pricing & Plans

Outbound System operates on a month-to-month model with no long-term contracts. Cold email starts at $1,999/month flat or a custom pay-per-lead rate. LinkedIn outreach starts at $499/month. Cold calling is $3,999/month per dedicated SDR. Most clients combine two or three channels and see 5-15x ROI within the first 90 days.

## Cold Email Pricing

Cold email is the highest-volume channel and the foundation of most client campaigns. Two pricing models let you choose between risk elimination (pay per lead) and cost efficiency at scale (flat retainer).

<Tabs>

  <Tab title="Pay Per Lead (Most Popular)">

**Custom pricing per qualified lead**

One-time setup fee + monthly technology fee. You only pay when we deliver leads matching your agreed ICP criteria. No qualified leads delivered? No lead charges. Your per-lead price is based on target market, deal complexity, and volume — quoted on the growth plan call.

This model aligns incentives completely: we only earn when you get results.

**What is included:**

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Lead qualification | Only charged for leads matching your agreed criteria |
| Email infrastructure | 350+ dedicated Microsoft Outlook inboxes on private Azure servers |
| Inbox placement | 98%+ inbox placement rate |
| Personalization | AI signal-based personalization (not basic merge tags) |
| Campaigns | Unlimited campaigns, A/B tests, and messaging sequences |
| Account management | Dedicated account manager with real-time dashboard |
| List building | Qualified target lead lists built for your ICP |
| CRM integration | Direct integrations with HubSpot, Salesforce, and others |
| Launch timeline | 14 days from signed agreement to live campaigns |
| Contract | Month-to-month — cancel anytime |

<Info>

**Best for:** Companies testing outbound for the first time, entering a new market or ICP, or those who have been burned by agencies charging retainers without delivering results. This model eliminates downside risk — we have to produce to earn.

</Info>

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Flat Retainer">

**$1,999/month**

Predictable cost. Unlimited qualified leads within your campaign scope. One flat monthly investment for maximum volume and full campaign control. At higher meeting volumes, the per-lead cost drops significantly below the pay-per-lead model — most clients generating 15+ meetings/month save 30-50% on this plan.

**What is included:**

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Lead volume | Unlimited qualified leads within your campaign scope |
| Email infrastructure | 700+ dedicated Microsoft Outlook inboxes on private Azure servers |
| Inbox placement | 98%+ inbox placement rate |
| Personalization | AI signal-based personalization (not basic merge tags) |
| Campaigns | Unlimited campaigns, A/B tests, and messaging sequences |
| Account management | Dedicated account manager with real-time dashboard |
| List building | Qualified target lead lists built for your ICP |
| Optimization | Weekly optimization: new angles tested, targeting tightened |
| CRM integration | Direct integrations with HubSpot, Salesforce, and others |
| Launch timeline | 14 days from signed agreement to live campaigns |
| Contract | Month-to-month — cancel anytime |

<Info>

**Best for:** Companies with established sales processes that can handle 15-30+ meetings per month. If you know your close rate and deal size, this model delivers the lowest cost per acquired customer at scale.

## LinkedIn Outreach Pricing

LinkedIn delivers near-100% message visibility — unlike email where inbox placement is a constant battle. Campaigns launch in 3-5 days. All plans use human-like sending patterns calibrated to stay within LinkedIn's guidelines: 600+ profiles managed with zero account bans.

| Feature | Growth | Scale (Most Popular) | Enterprise |
|---------|--------|---------------------|------------|
| **Monthly price** | $499/mo | $699/mo | $999/mo |
| **LinkedIn messages/month** | 2,000+ | 4,000+ | 8,000+ |
| **Profile optimization** | — | Included | Included |
| **Meeting booking** | — | — | We handle scheduling directly on your calendar |
| Campaigns and A/B tests | Unlimited | Unlimited | Unlimited |
| Lead lists via Sales Navigator | Unlimited qualified | Unlimited qualified | Unlimited qualified |
| Messaging sequences | Human-written | Human-written | Human-written |
| Account manager | Dedicated | Dedicated | Dedicated |
| Inbox management | We handle responses | Unified management | Unified management |
| Dashboard | Real-time monitoring | Real-time monitoring | Real-time monitoring |
| CRM integrations | Direct | Direct | Direct |
| Launch timeline | 5 days | 5 days | 5 days |

<Tip>

**Growth vs. Scale decision:** If you are running LinkedIn as a secondary channel alongside cold email, Growth at $499/month gives you solid volume. If LinkedIn is a primary channel or your ICP is heavily active on the platform, Scale doubles your message volume and adds profile optimization — your profile starts selling before you say a word. Enterprise is for teams that want meetings booked directly on their calendar with zero manual scheduling.

</Tip>

## Cold Calling Pricing

**$3,999/month per SDR**

A dedicated, trained cold caller making up to 300 dials every day. We recruit a top 1% SDR with 3+ years of B2B experience, train them on your offer, market, and objection handling, then put them on the phone calling your ideal prospects. You get a dedicated sales professional — not a call center reading a script.

| Metric | Performance |
|--------|-------------|
| Total dials made (platform-wide) | 11M+ |
| Meetings booked (platform-wide) | 72K |
| Show-up rate | 90%+ |
| Connect rate | 20%+ |
| Meetings per month per SDR | 10-30+ |

**What is included:**

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Daily dial volume | Up to 300 dials per day |
| Meeting booking | Directly on your calendar |
| Account management | Dedicated U.S. account manager |
| SDR experience | 3+ years B2B, recruited and trained specifically for you |
| Qualification | Custom qualification questions asked before booking |
| Scripts | Professional cold call scripts written by our copy team |
| Phone data | Triple-validated B2B phone data — no garbage numbers |
| Call recording | All calls verified, recorded, and accessible in your dashboard |
| Caller ID | Clean caller ID management (no spam flags) |
| Sales coaching | Coaching to help you close booked meetings |
| Campaign metrics | Real-time metrics and CRM integrations |
| Compliance | Fully compliant with TCPA/TSR |
| Launch timeline | 14 days from signed agreement to calling |

<Info>

**Signal-based calling converts at a different rate.** Your SDR does not cold-call a random list. They call prospects who have opened your emails 3x, clicked your case study, or visited your pricing page. That context turns a "cold" call into a warm conversation. Pairing cold calling with email and LinkedIn is how clients hit 30-80+ meetings per month.

</Info>

## Multi-Channel Pricing: How the Math Works

Most clients run two or three channels simultaneously. The compounding effect is significant — prospects who see your brand across email, LinkedIn, and phone convert at 3-4x the rate of single-channel outreach.

| Configuration | Monthly Cost | Typical Meetings/Month | Cost Per Meeting |
|---------------|-------------|----------------------|------------------|
| Cold email only (flat retainer) | $1,999 | 15-25 | $80-$133 |
| LinkedIn only (Scale) | $699 | 8-15 | $47-$87 |
| Cold email + LinkedIn (Scale) | $2,698 | 20-35 | $77-$135 |
| Cold email + cold calling | $5,998 | 25-50 | $120-$240 |
| All three channels | $6,697 | 30-80+ | $84-$223 |

<Warning>

These cost-per-meeting figures represent agency fees only. Your total cost of acquisition also includes the sales time to run discovery calls and close deals. At a $25K average deal size and 15% close rate, a $100 cost-per-meeting translates to roughly $667 in outbound cost per closed deal — a 37:1 return.

</Warning>

## How This Compares to Alternatives

The real pricing question is not "what does Outbound System cost" — it is "what does this cost compared to the alternatives that produce the same pipeline."

| Option | Monthly Cost | Meetings/Month | Ramp Time | Hidden Costs |
|--------|-------------|---------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Outbound System (email + LinkedIn)** | $2,698 | 20-35 | 14 days | None — infrastructure, lists, copy all included |
| **In-house SDR** | $6,250-$10,000 | 10-20 | 3-6 months | Benefits ($1,500-$2,500/mo), tools ($500-$1,000/mo), management overhead, training, turnover risk |
| **DIY tools (Apollo, Instantly, etc.)** | $500-$1,500 | 3-8 | 2-4 months | Your time (20-30 hrs/week), deliverability mistakes, list quality issues, no optimization expertise |
| **Other outbound agencies** | $3,000-$10,000 | 8-20 | 30-60 days | Long-term contracts (6-12 months), setup fees ($2K-$5K), limited infrastructure |

<Tip>

**The SDR comparison in detail:** A full-time SDR costs $75K-$120K per year in base salary plus benefits, tools, and management time. That SDR takes 3-6 months to ramp, produces 10-20 meetings per month at peak, and creates a single point of failure when they quit (average SDR tenure is 14 months). For less than half that annual cost, Outbound System delivers more meetings with zero ramp time, no turnover risk, and infrastructure that runs independently of any single person.

</Tip>

## What Is Included vs. What Costs Extra

Every plan includes the full infrastructure and execution stack. There are no hidden fees, upsells, or surprise charges.

| Included in Every Plan | Not Included (You Provide) |
|------------------------|---------------------------|
| Email and LinkedIn infrastructure setup | Your calendar/scheduling tool (Calendly, HubSpot, etc.) |
| Domain purchasing, warming, and rotation | Your CRM (we integrate with it, you own it) |
| ICP research and lead list building | Sales team to run discovery calls on booked meetings |
| AI signal-based copywriting and personalization | Follow-up process for no-shows and post-meeting nurture |
| Dedicated account manager | |
| Real-time campaign dashboard | |
| A/B testing and weekly optimization | |
| CRM integrations (HubSpot, Salesforce, Pipedrive) | |
| Deliverability monitoring and inbox placement | |
| Monthly performance reporting | |

## ROI Framework: From Cost Per Meeting to Revenue

Outbound pricing only matters in the context of what it produces. Here is the math across three deal-size scenarios, assuming a $2,698/month multi-channel investment (cold email + LinkedIn Scale).

| Metric | $10K Deal Size | $25K Deal Size | $50K Deal Size |
|--------|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| Monthly outbound cost | $2,698 | $2,698 | $2,698 |
| Meetings booked/month | 25 | 25 | 25 |
| Close rate | 15% | 15% | 15% |
| Deals closed/month | 3.75 | 3.75 | 3.75 |
| Monthly revenue from outbound | $37,500 | $93,750 | $187,500 |
| Monthly ROI | 13.9x | 34.7x | 69.5x |
| Annual revenue from outbound | $450,000 | $1,125,000 | $2,250,000 |
| Annual outbound cost | $32,376 | $32,376 | $32,376 |

<Info>

At a $25K average deal size — which is typical for B2B SaaS and professional services — a $2,698/month investment generates $93,750 in monthly revenue at a 15% close rate. That is a 34.7x monthly return. Even at a conservative 10% close rate, the return is 23x. The economics of outbound at this deal size are difficult to match with any other growth channel.

</Info>

## Month-to-Month: No Long-Term Lock-In

Every Outbound System plan is month-to-month. No 6-month minimums, no annual contracts, no cancellation fees. You stay because the pipeline keeps flowing, not because a contract forces you to.

This structure exists because we believe results should earn retention. Clients who see 15-25 meetings per month hitting their calendar do not need a contract to keep paying — they need more calendar slots. Average client retention exceeds 10 months because the ROI is visible within the first 30 days, not because we lock anyone in.

The 14-day launch timeline means you see booked meetings before your first invoice is 30 days old. If the results are not there, you cancel. No penalties, no hassle, no exit negotiations.

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="How do I choose between pay-per-lead and the flat retainer for cold email?">
    Pay-per-lead is ideal if you are testing outbound for the first time, entering an unproven market, or want zero downside risk — you only pay when qualified leads are delivered. The flat retainer at $1,999/month is better if you have an established sales process and can handle 15+ meetings per month, because the per-lead cost drops 30-50% compared to the pay-per-lead model at that volume. Most clients start on pay-per-lead for the first 1-2 months, validate that the leads convert, then switch to the flat retainer to maximize volume.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Are there any setup fees or hidden costs?">
    The pay-per-lead cold email plan includes a one-time setup fee and a monthly technology fee, which are quoted on the growth plan call based on your campaign scope. The flat retainer and all LinkedIn plans have no setup fees — the monthly price covers everything. Cold calling has no setup fees. There are no hidden costs on any plan: infrastructure, list building, copywriting, A/B testing, CRM integrations, and account management are all included.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What kind of ROI should I expect in the first 90 days?">
    Most clients see 5-15x ROI within 90 days, though the exact figure depends on your deal size and close rate. At a $25K average deal and 15% close rate, a multi-channel plan at $2,698/month produces roughly $93,750 in monthly revenue — a 34.7x return. First meetings are typically booked within 14 days of launch. By month two, most clients reach steady-state volume of 15-25 meetings per month on cold email alone, with LinkedIn and cold calling adding incremental volume on top.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does this compare to hiring an in-house SDR?">
    A full-time in-house SDR costs $75K-$120K per year in base salary, plus $18K-$30K in benefits, $6K-$12K in tools (CRM, dialer, email platform, data providers), and management overhead. That SDR takes 3-6 months to ramp, averages 10-20 meetings per month at peak, and creates turnover risk (average tenure is 14 months). Outbound System delivers more meetings at less than half the annual cost, launches in 14 days, and has no single-point-of-failure risk. The infrastructure keeps running even if your account manager changes.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I combine multiple channels for a custom package?">
    Yes — most clients run two or three channels. The most common combination is cold email (flat retainer at $1,999) plus LinkedIn Scale ($699) for $2,698/month total, which typically generates 20-35 meetings per month. Adding cold calling ($3,999/SDR) is how clients scale to 30-80+ meetings per month using signal-based dialing on prospects already warmed by email and LinkedIn. On the growth plan call, we recommend the right mix based on your ICP, deal size, and meeting capacity.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if I want to cancel?">
    You cancel. No penalties, no fees, no exit interviews. Every plan is month-to-month with no minimum commitment. If you cancel mid-month, your campaigns run through the end of that billing period. Your data, reports, and campaign history remain accessible. We find that clients who cancel typically return within 3-6 months after resolving an internal capacity issue — the door is always open.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is my LinkedIn account safe with your outreach tool?">
    Yes. We use the safest automation tools with human-like sending patterns calibrated to stay within LinkedIn's guidelines. We have managed 600+ profiles with zero account bans. Campaigns launch in 3-5 days, and the sending volume is distributed across time zones and patterns that mirror natural LinkedIn behavior. Near-100% message visibility means your prospects actually see your outreach — unlike email where inbox placement is a constant variable.

# Pricing & Plans

Outbound System is a fully managed outbound service — not a software tool you run yourself. Every plan includes dedicated infrastructure, ICP research, lead list building, AI-driven copywriting, A/B testing, account management, real-time dashboards, and CRM integrations. Most multi-channel clients invest between 2,500 and 5,000 per month and generate 20-50+ qualified meetings in return. Every plan is month-to-month with no long-term contracts.

## What Is Included in Every Plan

Before looking at channel-specific pricing, understand what you are buying. This is not a per-seat license for software. It is a team and system executing your outbound end to end.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Infrastructure and Deliverability">
    Every cold email campaign runs on dedicated Microsoft Outlook inboxes hosted on private Azure servers — not shared infrastructure. All inboxes maintain 98%+ inbox placement rates through continuous warming, rotation, and deliverability monitoring. Domain purchasing, DNS configuration, and reputation management are fully handled. You never touch a sending domain or worry about landing in spam. Building this infrastructure yourself would cost $2,000-$4,000/month before sending a single message.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Targeting and List Building">
    Qualified target lead lists are built specifically for your ICP using firmographic data (industry, revenue, headcount, tech stack), intent signals, and manual verification. Lists are continuously refreshed and deduplicated against your CRM and previous campaigns. For LinkedIn, lists are built through Sales Navigator with unlimited qualified leads across all tiers. The list building alone replaces $500-$1,500/month in data tool subscriptions plus 15-20 hours/month of manual research.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Copy and Personalization">
    All messaging is written by our copy team using AI signal-based personalization — not basic merge tags. Personalization is driven by prospect behavior signals, company triggers (funding rounds, new hires, product launches), and industry-specific angles. Every campaign includes unlimited A/B testing across subject lines, opening hooks, CTAs, and sequence length. This replaces a $4K-$8K/month copywriter or the 10+ hours/week a founder spends writing outreach.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Account Management and Reporting">
    Every client gets a dedicated account manager with a real-time campaign dashboard showing sends, opens, replies, meetings booked, and pipeline attribution. Weekly optimization cycles test new angles, tighten targeting, and adjust send volumes based on performance data. Direct CRM integrations push booked meetings and lead data into HubSpot, Salesforce, Pipedrive, or your system of choice.

## Cold Email Pricing

Cold email is the highest-volume channel and the foundation of most client campaigns. Choose between two pricing models depending on where you are and how you want to manage risk.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Pay Per Lead (Most Popular)">
    **Custom pricing per qualified lead**

    You only pay when we deliver leads matching your agreed ICP criteria. No qualified leads delivered? No charges. Your per-lead price is quoted on the growth plan call based on target market, deal complexity, and volume. There is a one-time setup fee and a monthly technology fee — both quoted upfront with no surprises.

    This model exists for a reason: our incentives are 100% aligned with yours. We have to produce to earn.

    | What is included     | Detail                                                            |
    | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | Lead qualification   | Only charged for leads matching your agreed criteria              |
    | Email infrastructure | 350+ dedicated Microsoft Outlook inboxes on private Azure servers |
    | Inbox placement      | 98%+ placement rate                                               |
    | Personalization      | AI signal-based (not basic merge tags)                            |
    | Campaigns            | Unlimited campaigns, A/B tests, and messaging sequences           |
    | Account management   | Dedicated manager with real-time dashboard                        |
    | List building        | Qualified target lead lists built for your ICP                    |
    | CRM integration      | Direct integrations — HubSpot, Salesforce, Pipedrive, and others  |
    | Launch timeline      | 14 days from signed agreement to live campaigns                   |
    | Contract             | Month-to-month — cancel anytime                                   |

    <Info>
      **Best for:** Companies testing outbound for the first time, entering a new market or ICP, or teams that have been burned by agencies charging retainers without delivering results. This model eliminates downside risk entirely.
    </Info>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Flat Retainer — $1,999/month">
    **\$1,999/month — unlimited qualified leads within your campaign scope**

    One flat monthly investment for maximum volume and full campaign control. At higher meeting volumes, the per-lead cost drops significantly below the pay-per-lead model — most clients generating 15+ meetings/month save 30-50% on this plan compared to pay-per-lead pricing.

    For context: \$1,999/month is less than the cost of the email infrastructure alone if you built it yourself. The retainer covers infrastructure, 700+ dedicated inboxes, list building, copywriting, optimization, and dedicated account management — the full stack.

    | What is included     | Detail                                                            |
    | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | Lead volume          | Unlimited qualified leads within your campaign scope              |
    | Email infrastructure | 700+ dedicated Microsoft Outlook inboxes on private Azure servers |
    | Inbox placement      | 98%+ placement rate                                               |
    | Personalization      | AI signal-based (not basic merge tags)                            |
    | Campaigns            | Unlimited campaigns, A/B tests, and messaging sequences           |
    | Account management   | Dedicated manager with real-time dashboard                        |
    | List building        | Qualified target lead lists built for your ICP                    |
    | Optimization         | Weekly: new angles tested, targeting tightened                    |
    | CRM integration      | Direct integrations — HubSpot, Salesforce, Pipedrive, and others  |
    | Launch timeline      | 14 days from signed agreement to live campaigns                   |
    | Contract             | Month-to-month — cancel anytime                                   |

    <Info>
      **Best for:** Companies with established sales processes that can handle 15-30+ meetings per month. If you know your close rate and deal size, this model delivers the lowest cost per acquired customer at scale.
    </Info>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tip>
  **Which model to start with:** Most clients begin on pay-per-lead to validate that the leads convert with zero downside risk. Once results are proven (typically 1-2 months), they switch to the \$1,999/month retainer to maximize volume and cut per-lead cost by 30-50%. This is the progression we recommend.
</Tip>

## LinkedIn Outreach Pricing

LinkedIn delivers near-100% message visibility — unlike email where inbox placement is a constant variable. Campaigns launch in 5 days. All plans include unlimited campaigns and A/B tests, unlimited qualified lead lists via Sales Navigator, human-written messaging sequences, a dedicated account manager, unified inbox management, real-time dashboards, and direct CRM integrations.

For comparison: a LinkedIn Sales Navigator subscription alone costs $100-$180/month. A LinkedIn automation tool adds $80-$200/month. A virtual assistant to run sequences and manage responses adds 1,500-3,000/month. The fully managed plans below replace all three.

|                                | Growth              | Scale (Most Popular) | Enterprise                        |

<Info>
  **Account safety:** We use the safest automation tools with human-like sending patterns calibrated to stay within LinkedIn's guidelines. Over 600 profiles managed with zero account bans. Your campaign launches in 3-5 days with near-100% message visibility.
</Info>

<Tip>
  **Choosing your tier:** Growth (499) works well as a secondary channel alongside cold email — solid volume at minimal additional investment. Scale (699) is the right choice if LinkedIn is a primary channel or your ICP is heavily active on the platform — double the message volume plus profile optimization that starts selling before you say a word. Enterprise (\$999) is for teams that want the highest volume and meetings booked directly on their calendar with zero manual scheduling.

## AI Cold Calling Pricing

AI-powered cold calling that makes 250 to 1,000 dials per day and books 20-50 meetings per month — starting at \$999/month. This is not a human SDR splitting time across multiple clients, and it is not a robocall. It is a real-time, two-way AI conversation system that adapts to each prospect's responses, handles objections live, qualifies interest, and books meetings directly on your calendar.

Every call is personalized with context: industry, role, company activity, and specific pain points. The AI references something real about the prospect's business, then navigates the conversation based on how they respond. Scripts are built from data across thousands of B2B campaigns and approved by you before a single dial is made. Every conversation is recorded, verified, and accessible in your real-time dashboard.

For context: hiring an in-house SDR costs $50K-$80K/year fully loaded, produces 50-80 dials on a good day, takes 3-6 months to ramp, and 50% quit within the first year. Traditional cold calling agencies charge $4,000-$8,000/month for a single human SDR who juggles 2-4 other clients and makes 100-150 dials per day. AI calling starts at \$999/month, launches in 5 days, scales instantly, and delivers 100% script adherence on every call.

| Metric                           | Performance |
| -------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Total dials made (platform-wide) | 11M+        |
| Meetings booked (platform-wide)  | 72K+        |
| Revenue closed from our leads    | \$26M+      |
| Launch timeline                  | 5 days      |

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Starter — $999/month">
    **\$999/month — up to 250 dials per day**

    5,000+ dials per month with a fully managed AI calling system producing 20-40 qualified meetings. At \$999/month, a single closed deal at virtually any B2B deal size pays for the entire service for months.

    | What is included   | Detail                                                          |

    <Info>
      **Best for:** Companies adding cold calling as a channel for the first time, testing AI calling before scaling, or teams with a focused ICP that can be reached with 250 dials per day. At this volume, even a 1-2% meeting conversion rate produces 5-10+ meetings per month.
    </Info>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Scale — $1,999/month (Most Popular)">
    **\$1,999/month — up to 500 dials per day**

    10,000+ dials per month. Double the volume, double the data, faster optimization cycles. Clients on the Scale plan consistently book 20-50 meetings per month because 500 daily dials generate enough conversation data to optimize scripts, timing, and targeting within weeks rather than months.

    | What is included   | Detail                                                          |

    <Info>
      **Best for:** Companies making cold calling a primary channel, teams running multi-channel campaigns where calling is the conversion driver, or businesses targeting phone-responsive audiences (contractors, healthcare, local services, operational decision-makers). The 500 dials/day volume generates enough data for weekly optimization that compounds conversion rates over time.
    </Info>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tip>
  **How AI calling compares to human SDR agencies:** Traditional agencies charge $4,000-$8,000/month for one human SDR making 150-300 dials per day (realistically 100-150). That SDR splits time across 2-4 clients, has variable performance depending on mood and motivation, and delivers a monthly PDF report. At \$999-\$1,999/month, AI calling delivers 250-500 dials per day with 100% script adherence, real-time dashboards, zero turnover risk, and launches in 5 days instead of 30. The economics and performance gap are not close.
</Tip>

## Multi-Channel: Where the Compounding Happens

Single-channel outbound produces linear results. Multi-channel produces compounding results because prospects encounter your brand across multiple surfaces before the pitch. A prospect who has seen your LinkedIn request, read two emails, and then receives a phone call referencing those touchpoints converts at 3-4x the rate of a prospect who only received a cold email. Clients running all three channels see 2-3x the meetings compared to single-channel approaches.

Here is what common configurations cost and produce:

| Configuration                                           | Monthly Investment | Typical Meetings/Month | Effective Cost Per Meeting |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Cold email retainer only                                | \$1,999            | 15-25                  | $80-$133                   |
| LinkedIn Scale only                                     | \$699              | 8-15                   | $47-$87                    |
| AI cold calling Starter only                            | \$999              | 10-25                  | $40-$100                   |
| Cold email retainer + LinkedIn Scale                    | \$2,698            | 20-35                  | $77-$135                   |
| Cold email retainer + AI calling Scale                  | \$3,998            | 30-50                  | $80-$133                   |
| Cold email retainer + LinkedIn Scale + AI calling Scale | \$4,697            | 40-80+                 | $59-$117                   |

<Warning>
  These cost-per-meeting figures represent the agency investment only. Your total cost of acquisition also includes the sales time to run discovery calls and close deals. At a 25K average deal size and 15% close rate, a 100 cost per meeting translates to roughly \$667 in outbound cost per closed deal — a 37:1 return on the agency spend.
</Warning>

## ROI Framework: From Investment to Revenue

Pricing only matters relative to what it produces. Here is the math at three deal-size levels, using the most common multi-channel setup (cold email retainer + LinkedIn Scale at \$2,698/month).

<Info>
  At a 25K average deal size — typical for B2B SaaS and professional services — the most popular multi-channel configuration (2,698/month) produces roughly \$93,750 in monthly revenue at a 15% close rate. That is a 34.7x monthly return. Even at a conservative 10% close rate, the return is 23x. The economics of managed outbound at this deal size are difficult to match with any other growth channel.

## Month-to-Month: No Long-Term Lock-In

Every plan is month-to-month. No 6-month minimums, no annual contracts, no cancellation fees. Cold email and LinkedIn campaigns launch in 5-14 days. AI cold calling launches in 5 days. You see booked meetings before your first invoice is 30 days old. If the results are not there, you walk away.

This is deliberate. Agencies that lock clients into long contracts do it because their results do not justify voluntary retention. Our clients stay because 15-50+ meetings per month hitting their calendar is a pipeline engine they cannot afford to turn off — not because paperwork says they cannot leave. That accountability model is a big reason 70+ clients came from referrals and we maintain a 4.8-star rating across Trustpilot and G2.

For a detailed look at what each channel includes, see our [cold email service](/services/cold-email), [LinkedIn outreach service](/services/linkedin-outbound), and [AI cold calling service](/services/cold-calling). To confirm you match the criteria for strong outbound ROI, review our [ideal client profile](/fit/ideal-client) or read the [outsourced vs. in-house SDR comparison](/knowledge-base/outsourced-vs-in-house).

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I choose between pay-per-lead and the flat retainer for cold email?">
    Pay-per-lead eliminates downside risk — you only pay when qualified leads matching your ICP are delivered. It is ideal for first-time outbound buyers or companies entering unproven markets. The \$1,999/month flat retainer provides unlimited leads at a predictable cost, and clients generating 15+ meetings per month save 30-50% per lead compared to pay-per-lead pricing. Most clients start on pay-per-lead for 1-2 months to validate that leads convert, then switch to the retainer to maximize volume.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Are there setup fees or hidden costs?">
    The pay-per-lead cold email plan includes a one-time setup fee and monthly technology fee, both quoted upfront on the growth plan call. The flat retainer ($1,999/month), all LinkedIn plans ($499-$999/month), and AI cold calling plans ($999-\$1,999/month) have no setup fees — the monthly price is the total price. Infrastructure, list building, copywriting, A/B testing, CRM integrations, deliverability monitoring, and dedicated account management are all included in every plan.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="These prices seem low for a fully managed service — what is the catch?">
    There is no catch — the economics work because of scale, infrastructure efficiency, and AI. Cold email and LinkedIn run on shared operational processes (account management, optimization frameworks, copywriting systems) while dedicating individual infrastructure to each client (separate inboxes, separate domains, separate lead lists). AI cold calling replaces the most expensive and inconsistent part of outbound — human SDRs — with a system that scales from 250 to 1,000+ dials per day at a fraction of the cost. The month-to-month model is our proof: if results did not justify the investment, clients would leave. They do not.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What ROI should I expect in the first 90 days?">
    Most clients see 5-15x ROI within 90 days, depending on deal size and close rate. First meetings are typically booked within 5-14 days of launch depending on the channel. By month two, most clients reach steady-state volume of 15-25 meetings per month on cold email alone. Adding AI calling and LinkedIn pushes that to 30-80+ meetings per month. At a $25K average deal and 15% close rate on the most popular multi-channel plan ($2,698/month), the monthly return is 34.7x.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How does AI cold calling compare to hiring a human SDR or using a traditional agency?">
    An in-house SDR costs $50K-$80K/year fully loaded, makes 50-80 dials on a good day, takes 3-6 months to ramp, and 50% quit within the first year. Traditional cold calling agencies charge $4,000-$8,000/month for one human SDR who juggles 2-4 other clients and makes 100-150 actual dials per day. AI calling at $999-$1,999/month delivers 250-500 dials per day with 100% script adherence, zero turnover risk, real-time dashboards, and launches in 5 days. The AI adapts to each prospect's responses in real time — it is not a robocall or pre-recorded message. Every call is a two-way conversation personalized to the prospect's industry, role, and business challenges.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can prospects tell they are talking to an AI?">
    Rarely. The voice quality is indistinguishable from a professional human caller — natural tone, pacing, and inflection with no robotic pauses or synthetic artifacts. The conversation flows with natural transitions, appropriate responses to what the prospect says, and personalized context about their industry, role, and specific challenges. Prospects engage because the experience is authentic, relevant, and professional.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I start with one channel and add more later?">
    Yes, and most clients do exactly this. The typical path is starting with cold email (highest volume, lowest cost), adding LinkedIn once email performance is validated, and layering in AI cold calling to push past 30 meetings per month. Each channel is priced independently with no bundling requirement, so you scale your investment as your sales team's capacity grows.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens if I want to cancel?">
    You cancel. No penalties, no fees, no exit process. Every plan is month-to-month with 10 business days notice. If you cancel mid-month, campaigns run through the end of that billing period. Your data, reports, and campaign history remain accessible. The door is open if you want to restart later.

# Sales Navigator & TAM Building Guide

Your outbound pipeline is only as good as the list behind it. A 500-contact list built from verified intent signals will outproduce a 10,000-name spray-and-pray export every time — our campaigns consistently show that signal-based lists generate 3–5x more qualified meetings per send. This guide covers the exact filtering logic, Boolean structures, and multi-source enrichment process we use to build lists where 80%+ of contacts match the target persona on first pass.

## Account-Level Filters: Defining Your Target Company Profile

Account-level filters narrow the universe of companies before you ever look at individual contacts. Getting these right eliminates entire categories of waste — wrong-size companies, wrong industries, wrong geographies — before a single email is written.

These seven filters form the foundation of every high-performing list we build:

| Filter | Recommended Value | Why This Range |
|--------|------------------|----------------|
| Employee Headcount | 20–500 | Large enough to have budget and defined roles, small enough that decision-makers are reachable without gatekeepers. Companies under 20 rarely have dedicated buyers for B2B services. |
| Industry | Specific to ICP — never "all" | Broad industry selections (e.g., "Technology") pull millions of irrelevant results. Use sub-industries or pair with Boolean keywords to isolate your niche. |
| Annual Revenue | $5M–$100M | This range captures mid-market companies with real budgets. Below $5M, deal sizes shrink and sales cycles become unpredictable. Above $100M, procurement layers slow everything down. |
| HQ Location | United States (or specific states/metros) | Geography precision matters. "Los Angeles Metropolitan Area" includes Orange County, the Valley, and San Bernardino — "Los Angeles" is just the city. Choose based on your actual serviceable market. |
| Growth Rate | Positive / Growing | Companies in growth mode are actively hiring, expanding into new markets, and investing in tools and services. Stagnant or declining companies default to cost-cutting. |
| Recently Funded | Yes (when applicable) | Freshly funded companies have capital earmarked for growth initiatives. Series A through Series C companies are actively building the teams and infrastructure that require outside partners. |
| Hiring on LinkedIn | Active job postings | Companies posting jobs signal budget availability and organizational growth. A company hiring 3 sales reps is more likely to need sales enablement tools than one with a hiring freeze. |

<Warning>

Company headcount is the least reliable filter in Sales Navigator. Many companies mischaracterize their size or list no headcount at all. If you select every headcount option in an existing search, the list will actually shrink — because companies with no headcount data get excluded when any headcount filter is active. Always cross-reference headcount with a second source like Apollo or ZoomInfo.

</Warning>

## Contact-Level Filters: Finding the Right Person at the Right Company

Once your account-level filters define the company universe, contact-level filters isolate the actual decision-makers and influencers within those companies. The difference between a 2% and a 12% reply rate often comes down to whether you reached the person who owns the budget or someone two levels removed from it.

| Filter | Configuration | Implementation Notes |
|--------|--------------|---------------------|
| Title Keywords (Boolean) | Exact role titles with Boolean operators — see persona strings below | Never use broad titles alone. "Director" pulls Directors of every department. Always pair with a function: "Director of Marketing," "VP of Sales," "Head of Operations." |
| Seniority Level | VP, Director, CXO (include Experienced Manager only when brief requires it) | Always exclude Entry Level (110) and In Training (100). The "Senior" seniority level is powerful for expanding your total addressable market but pulls everything from "Senior Coordinator" to "CEO" — use it only with additional title exclusions. |
| Changed Jobs (Past 90 Days) | Enabled when targeting new decision-makers | People in new roles are 3–5x more likely to evaluate and purchase new solutions in their first 90 days. They're building their stack, proving themselves, and open to conversations. |
| Posted on LinkedIn (Past 30 Days) | Enabled for engagement-based targeting | Active posters are more likely to accept connection requests and respond to outreach. This filter also serves as a proxy for LinkedIn engagement — people who post are people who check their inbox. |
| Function | Specific to persona — Marketing (15), Sales (25), Finance (10), etc. | Exclude at least 5 irrelevant functions per search. Common exclusions: Administrative (2), Quality Assurance (22), Military and Protective Services (17), Community and Social Services (5), Legal (14). This is where unqualified prospects slip through. |

<Tip>

When targeting C-level executives, always include both the abbreviation and the full title. LinkedIn profiles are inconsistent — some list "CEO" while others write "Chief Executive Officer." Missing one variation means missing half your target list. The same applies to "Head of" titles: many senior leaders use "Head of Marketing" instead of "Director of Marketing" or "VP of Marketing."

</Tip>

### Mandatory Title Exclusions

Every search must exclude these 12 titles to prevent junior and irrelevant contacts from contaminating your list:

`intern, assistant, associate, student, coordinator, analyst, unemployed, self-employed, retired, furloughed, seeking, laid off`

If you include the "Senior" seniority level, add two more exclusions: `professor` and `specialist`. The Senior seniority level is the trickiest filter in Sales Navigator — it pulls contacts from "Senior Coordinator" through "CEO" and requires manual review of at least 5 pages deep to catch unqualified matches.

## Boolean Search Strings for 3 Buyer Personas

Boolean search queries the entire LinkedIn profile — current title, past roles, education, summary, and skills. This makes Boolean powerful for niche targeting but imprecise if you're not careful: someone who was a VP of Sales five years ago still matches a "VP Sales" keyword search even if they're now a consultant.

Use Boolean in addition to Sales Navigator filters, never as a replacement. Filters handle current-role targeting; Boolean handles niche refinement and edge cases the filters miss.

<Info>

Boolean best practice: always put quotes around multi-word phrases, always separate AND/OR/NOT with parentheses, and never use broad NOT exclusions like NOT "sales" — this removes anyone who mentions "sales" anywhere in their entire profile history.

<Tabs>

  <Tab title="Sales Leaders">

**Target:** VP/Director/Head of Sales at mid-market companies

```
("VP Sales" OR "VP of Sales" OR "Vice President of Sales" OR "Head of Sales" OR "CRO" OR "Chief Revenue Officer" OR "Director of Sales" OR "Sales Director") NOT ("Sales Associate" OR "Sales Rep" OR "Sales Representative" OR "Sales Coordinator" OR "SDR" OR "BDR")

**Pair with these filters:**
- Seniority: CXO, VP, Director
- Function: Sales (25), Business Development (4)
- Headcount: 20–500
- Exclude industries: Staffing and Recruiting (104), Professional Training and Coaching (105)

**Mentionability check:** "As a sales leader scaling a mid-market team..." — accurate for 80%+ of results.

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Growth / BD Leaders">

**Target:** VP/Head of Business Development or Growth at scaling companies

```
("VP Business Development" OR "VP of Business Development" OR "Vice President of Business Development" OR "Head of Growth" OR "Head of Business Development" OR "Director of Growth" OR "Director of Business Development" OR "Growth Lead") NOT ("Coordinator" OR "Specialist" OR "Associate" OR "Intern" OR "Assistant")

  <Tab title="Founder / CEO">

**Target:** Founders and CEOs at companies with 10–200 employees

```
("Founder" OR "Co-Founder" OR "CEO" OR "Chief Executive Officer" OR "Owner" OR "Managing Partner") NOT ("Intern" OR "Associate" OR "Student" OR "Freelance")

## Multi-Source TAM Building

Sales Navigator is the starting point, not the finish line. The highest-performing lists pull from 4–5 data sources and cross-reference them to build a Total Addressable Market (TAM) that no single tool can match alone. Each source contributes a different intelligence layer — contact data, technographic signals, funding events, or intent indicators.

| Source | What It Contributes | Best For |
|--------|-------------------|----------|
| **Apollo / ZoomInfo** | Verified emails, direct dials, org charts, company firmographics | Core contact data and company enrichment. Apollo covers 275M+ contacts; ZoomInfo is stronger on enterprise org charts and direct phone numbers. |
| **Crunchbase** | Funding rounds, investor data, growth signals, founding dates | Identifying recently funded companies (Series A–C), tracking acquisition activity, and filtering by funding stage. A company that closed a $15M Series B last quarter has budget and urgency. |
| **BuiltWith / Wappalyzer** | Technology stack detection — what tools a company uses | Technographic targeting. If your product replaces HubSpot, find every company running HubSpot. If you sell to Shopify merchants, find every site on Shopify. BuiltWith tracks 100,000+ web technologies across 673M+ websites. |
| **Clay** | Workflow orchestration — connects all sources, runs enrichment waterfalls, scores leads | Stitching everything together. Clay pulls from 75+ data providers in sequence, deduplicates, enriches, and outputs a single clean record. It replaces manual spreadsheet merging with automated enrichment chains. |

<Tip>

Company name keywords in Sales Navigator are the single most effective method for building clean, tight lists in specific niches. Instead of relying on broad industry filters, search company names for niche terms: "solar" for solar companies, "HVAC" for HVAC contractors, "CPA" for accounting firms. This approach produces lists where 90%+ of results are in your target niche, versus 60–70% accuracy from industry filters alone.

</Tip>

## The 9-Step Data Enrichment Process

Raw list exports are never campaign-ready. An unverified list will produce bounce rates above 5%, trigger spam filters, and burn your sending domains. This 9-step enrichment process transforms a raw export into a verified, scored, and personalized campaign list — the difference between a list that generates meetings and one that generates spam complaints.

<Steps>

  <Step title="Email Verification">

Run every email address through a verification tool (NeverBounce, ZeroBounce, or MillionVerifier). Remove any result that comes back as invalid, risky, or unknown. Target a verified rate above 95% — anything below that means your source data is stale. A single campaign sent to 8% invalid addresses can tank your sender reputation for weeks.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Phone Validation">

If your campaign includes cold calling or voicemail drops, validate phone numbers through a service that checks line type (mobile vs. landline vs. VoIP) and connection status. Direct dials convert at 3–5x the rate of main office lines. Remove disconnected numbers and flag mobile numbers separately for SMS-based sequences.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Company Enrichment">

Append firmographic data to every record: employee count, annual revenue, industry classification, founding year, HQ location, and company description. This data powers your segmentation — a 50-person SaaS startup requires fundamentally different messaging than a 500-person manufacturing firm, even if both have a VP of Sales.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Technographic Overlay">

Layer in technology stack data from BuiltWith or Wappalyzer. Identify what CRM, marketing automation, analytics, and infrastructure tools each company runs. Technographic data enables hyper-relevant messaging: "I noticed your team is running Salesforce and Outreach — here's how companies in your space are layering in [your tool] to close the gap between pipeline and revenue."

  </Step>

  <Step title="Intent Signal Check">

Cross-reference your list against intent data providers (Bombora, G2, TrustRadius) to identify which companies are actively researching solutions in your category. A prospect showing high intent — visiting competitor pages, reading category reviews, downloading comparison guides — is 3–7x more likely to take a meeting than a cold contact with no buying signals.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Suppression List Application">

Remove existing customers, active pipeline opportunities, competitors, partners, and any contacts who have previously opted out or marked your emails as spam. This step prevents embarrassing outreach ("Hi, I'd love to tell you about the product you already bought") and protects your sender reputation. Merge your CRM export, past campaign lists, and any client-provided exclusion lists into a single suppression file.

  </Step>

  <Step title="ICP Scoring">

Score every remaining contact against your Ideal Customer Profile using a weighted model. Assign points for firmographic fit (right size, right industry, right revenue), technographic fit (uses complementary or competitive tools), behavioral signals (intent data, LinkedIn activity, job changes), and engagement history (opened previous emails, visited your site). Contacts scoring below your threshold get deprioritized or removed — they dilute your reply rates and waste send volume.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Persona Matching">

Map each contact to a specific buyer persona and corresponding message sequence. A VP of Sales gets different pain points, proof points, and CTAs than a CTO — even at the same company. This step assigns each contact to the right sequence so every email reads like it was written for that person's specific role and challenges, not a generic "decision-maker" template.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Personalization Data Pull">

Extract the specific data points that will power first-line personalization in your outreach: recent LinkedIn posts, company news (funding rounds, product launches, expansions), mutual connections, shared alma maters, technology stack details, and hiring activity. Each contact should have 2–3 usable personalization hooks before it enters a campaign. Personalized first lines increase reply rates by 2–3x compared to generic openers.

  </Step>

</Steps>

## Why List Quality Beats List Size — Every Time

<Info>

500 contacts built from verified intent signals, enriched with technographics, and scored against your ICP will generate more qualified meetings than 10,000 contacts scraped from a single source with no verification. Our campaign data across 200+ B2B engagements confirms this consistently: signal-based lists produce 3–5x more meetings per 1,000 sends. The math is simple — a 12% reply rate on 500 contacts (60 replies) beats a 1.5% reply rate on 5,000 contacts (75 replies) because the 60 replies are 80%+ qualified while the 75 replies are mostly "not interested" and "remove me."

</Info>

The temptation to "just build a bigger list" is the single most common mistake in outbound. Bigger lists mean more generic messaging, lower deliverability (more bounces, more spam complaints), and lower conversion rates at every stage of the funnel. Precision targeting — fewer contacts, better data, more relevant messaging — compounds across the entire pipeline:

- **Deliverability:** Verified lists keep bounce rates under 2%, protecting sender reputation
- **Open rates:** Targeted subject lines to the right persona produce 55–70% open rates vs. 25–35% for generic sends
- **Reply rates:** Personalized outreach to signal-matched contacts generates 8–15% positive reply rates vs. 1–3% for bulk sends
- **Meeting conversion:** Qualified replies from ICP-fit contacts convert to booked meetings at 40–60% vs. 15–25% for unqualified replies

The compounding effect means that a 500-person precision list can produce 20–30 qualified meetings, while a 10,000-person generic list produces 10–15 meetings that are half as likely to close.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="How many contacts should I include in my first outbound list?">
    Start with 300–500 contacts that are tightly matched to your ICP, fully verified, and enriched with personalization data. This gives you enough volume to generate statistically meaningful results (expect 15–30 positive replies from a well-targeted list at this size) while keeping quality high enough to iterate on messaging. Once you've validated your targeting and sequences with this initial batch, expand to 1,000–2,000 contacts per month with confidence that your filters are producing qualified prospects.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Should I use Sales Navigator or a data provider like Apollo/ZoomInfo?">
    Use both — they serve different purposes. Sales Navigator excels at real-time filtering with the most current LinkedIn profile data (titles, companies, activity), making it the best tool for identifying your target audience. Apollo and ZoomInfo provide verified contact data (emails, phone numbers) and firmographic enrichment that Sales Navigator doesn't offer. The optimal workflow is to build your targeting criteria in Sales Navigator, then pull contact data from Apollo or ZoomInfo, and enrich further with Clay to fill gaps.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How accurate are Sales Navigator filters really?">
    Sales Navigator filters are approximately 80–90% accurate on their own. The biggest accuracy issues come from headcount data (companies frequently misreport or omit employee counts), the "Senior" seniority level (which pulls everything from Senior Coordinator to CEO), and industry classifications (many companies are miscategorized). You push accuracy toward 90%+ by layering Boolean keywords, excluding irrelevant functions and industries, and manually reviewing at least 5 pages of results before launching a campaign.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the difference between 2nd-degree and 3rd-degree connections for outreach?">
    2nd-degree connections consistently produce higher connection request acceptance rates than 3rd-degree connections because mutual connections create implicit trust. Only expand to 3rd-degree when your 2nd-degree list is too small to sustain your campaign volume. Note that Sales Navigator bundles 3rd-degree with all non-1st/2nd connections, so the reported list size can be misleading — many of those "3rd-degree" contacts have no meaningful path back to you.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I target a niche that doesn't map to a Sales Navigator industry?">
    Use company name keyword targeting — it's the most effective method for niche industries that Sales Navigator's industry taxonomy doesn't cover. Search for niche-specific terms in the company name filter: "solar" for solar companies, "HVAC" for HVAC contractors, "msp" for managed service providers. Combine this with Boolean keyword strings in the general search bar. For example, targeting MSPs requires a Boolean like ("msp" OR "mssp" OR "managed service provider" OR "managed services provider") because there's no MSP industry category in Sales Navigator.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How often should I refresh or rebuild my target list?">
    Refresh your list every 30–60 days. LinkedIn profiles change constantly — people switch jobs, update titles, and move companies. A list that was 90% accurate 60 days ago may be 70% accurate now due to natural contact decay. Each refresh should re-verify emails (expect 2–5% monthly decay), re-check employment status, apply updated suppression lists, and pull fresh intent signals. Building a new list from scratch every quarter ensures your filters and Boolean strings reflect any shifts in your ICP or market.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the most common mistake teams make when building outbound lists?">
    Building lists that are too broad because they prioritize volume over precision. The typical failure pattern is: use broad industry filters, skip Boolean refinement, skip title exclusions, export 10,000 contacts, and wonder why reply rates are under 2%. The fix is to start tight — narrow industry, specific titles, verified signals — validate that the list quality produces qualified replies, then expand methodically. A list where you can write "As a [title] in [industry]..." and have it feel accurate for 80%+ of contacts is a list worth emailing.

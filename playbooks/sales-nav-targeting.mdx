# Sales Navigator & TAM Building Guide

Your outbound pipeline is only as good as the list behind it. A 500-contact list built from verified intent signals will outproduce a 10,000-name spray-and-pray export every time — our campaigns consistently show that signal-based lists generate 3–5x more qualified meetings per send. This guide covers the exact filtering logic, Boolean structures, niche targeting shortcuts, and multi-source enrichment process we use to build lists where 80%+ of contacts match the target persona on first pass.

## The 10 Targeting Commandments

Before diving into filter mechanics, internalize these principles. They're distilled from thousands of campaigns and represent the difference between lists that produce pipeline and lists that produce spam complaints.

1. **Every list must have a mentionable persona.** If you can't describe who they are in one sentence, it's too broad. The test: can you write "As a [title] in [industry]..." and have it feel accurate for 80%+ of results?
2. **Company name niche is the #1 method for clean lists.** Searching "solar" in the company name field beats selecting the "Renewables" industry filter every time.
3. **Job title niche is #2.** Specific titles paired with functions outperform broad seniority-level targeting.
4. **Account lists (company-based targeting) are #3.** Curating a list of specific target companies and uploading it produces the tightest targeting.
5. **Boolean keywords are #4.** Powerful for niches that don't map to Sales Navigator's taxonomy, but imprecise because they search entire profile history.
6. **"Senior" seniority expands TAM but always pulls juniors.** If you use it, review at least 5 pages deep and add extra title exclusions.
7. **Synonyms, plurals, and insider terms are your best friend.** Research how your niche actually describes itself — "MSP" and "managed service provider" target the same people but live in different profiles.
8. **Always scroll through at least 5 pages of results.** You'll catch agencies, consultants, recruiters, fraternities, and education contacts that slipped through filters.
9. **When a campaign underperforms, it's usually because the list is weak.** Weak lists mean the copy can't be specific enough to resonate.
10. **2nd-degree connections always outperform 3rd-degree** on acceptance rates. Start with 2nd-degree only and expand to 3rd-degree as a last resort.

## Account-Level Filters: Defining Your Target Company Profile

Account-level filters narrow the universe of companies before you ever look at individual contacts. Getting these right eliminates entire categories of waste — wrong-size companies, wrong industries, wrong geographies — before a single email is written.

These seven filters form the foundation of every high-performing list we build:

| Filter | Recommended Value | Why This Range |
|--------|------------------|----------------|
| Employee Headcount | 20–500 | Large enough to have budget and defined roles, small enough that decision-makers are reachable without gatekeepers. Companies under 20 rarely have dedicated buyers for B2B services. |
| Industry | Specific to ICP — never "all" | Broad industry selections (e.g., "Technology") pull millions of irrelevant results. Use sub-industries or pair with Boolean keywords to isolate your niche. |
| Annual Revenue | $5M–$100M | This range captures mid-market companies with real budgets. Below $5M, deal sizes shrink and sales cycles become unpredictable. Above $100M, procurement layers slow everything down. |
| HQ Location | United States (or specific states/metros) | Geography precision matters — see the geography section below for critical nuances. |
| Growth Rate | Positive / Growing | Companies in growth mode are actively hiring, expanding into new markets, and investing in tools and services. Stagnant or declining companies default to cost-cutting. |
| Recently Funded | Yes (when applicable) | Freshly funded companies have capital earmarked for growth initiatives. Series A through Series C companies are actively building the teams and infrastructure that require outside partners. |
| Hiring on LinkedIn | Active job postings | Companies posting jobs signal budget availability and organizational growth. A company hiring 3 sales reps is more likely to need sales enablement tools than one with a hiring freeze. |

<Warning>

Company headcount is the least reliable filter in Sales Navigator. Many companies mischaracterize their size or list no headcount at all. If you select every headcount option in an existing search, the list will actually shrink — because companies with no headcount data get excluded when any headcount filter is active. When a client wants to exclude only "Self-employed" and "1–10," you must select all other sizes (11–50 through 10,000+), which also excludes companies with no headcount data. Always cross-reference headcount with a second source like Apollo or ZoomInfo.

</Warning>

### Geography Precision Warnings

Geography encoding in Sales Navigator is full of traps that silently degrade list quality. These are the ones that burn teams most often:

- **"Georgia" is also a country.** If you're targeting the U.S. state, you must specify "Georgia, United States" — otherwise you'll pull contacts from the Republic of Georgia in Eastern Europe.
- **Metro areas vs. cities are not the same.** "Los Angeles Metropolitan Area" includes Orange County, the Valley, Malibu, San Bernardino, and Pasadena. "Los Angeles" is just the city itself. The metro area can be 3–5x larger than the city proper.
- **Metro areas bleed into neighboring regions.** "Greater Denver Area" includes Boulder, CO. People from Boulder don't consider themselves "Denver" — writing "fellow Denver business owner" in outreach to a Boulder contact creates an immediate disconnect.
- **Sales Navigator defaults to metro areas.** When you type a city name, the autocomplete often selects the metro area instead of the city. Always verify the exact filter value after selecting.

### Mandatory Industry Exclusions

Exclude at least 5 irrelevant industries per search. These industries frequently pollute lead lists because their members match almost every keyword and title combination:

| Industry | Why It Pollutes Lists |
|----------|--------------------|
| Staffing and Recruiting | Recruiters match nearly every keyword because their profiles mention every industry they recruit for. This is the single most common source of list contamination. |
| Business Consulting and Services | Consultants describe themselves using their clients' industry language, making them match any industry-targeted search. |
| Professional Training and Coaching | Coaches and trainers use the same terminology as the functions they serve — a "sales coach" matches every Sales Leader search. |
| Market Research | Researchers describe the markets they study, matching industry-specific Boolean strings. |
| IT Services and IT Consulting | IT consultants match every technology-related keyword. |

Adapt exclusions to match the specific brief. If you're targeting restaurants, also exclude marketing, staffing, and technology industries. If you're targeting financial services, exclude legal services and accounting (unless those are your actual targets).

### Company Type Selection Guide

The Company Type filter controls what kind of corporate entity appears in your results. Misselecting here introduces noise that no amount of title or Boolean filtering can fix:

| Type | When to Include | When to Exclude |
|------|----------------|-----------------|
| Privately Held | Targeting SMBs and mid-market companies | Targeting only public enterprises |
| Public Company | Targeting enterprise or publicly traded companies | Targeting founder-led or bootstrapped companies |
| Self Owned | Targeting small business owners and solo operators | Targeting companies with established teams |
| Partnership | Targeting professional services firms (law firms, accounting, consulting) | Targeting product companies |
| Self Employed | Almost never — unless specifically targeting freelancers | Always exclude by default; solo consultants rarely have B2B purchasing authority |
| Non Profit | Only when nonprofits are the explicit target | Always exclude unless intentional |
| Government Agency | Only when government buyers are the explicit target | Always exclude unless intentional |
| Educational Institution | Only when education sector is the explicit target | Always exclude unless intentional |

<Tip>

When a brief says "small, private companies," the correct Company Type combination is Privately Held + Self Owned + Partnership. Do NOT include Self Employed — that filter pulls freelancers, solo consultants, and gig workers who almost never have purchasing authority for B2B products and services.

</Tip>

## Contact-Level Filters: Finding the Right Person at the Right Company

Once your account-level filters define the company universe, contact-level filters isolate the actual decision-makers and influencers within those companies. The difference between a 2% and a 12% reply rate often comes down to whether you reached the person who owns the budget or someone two levels removed from it.

| Filter | Configuration | Implementation Notes |
|--------|--------------|---------------------|
| Title Keywords (Boolean) | Exact role titles with Boolean operators — see persona strings below | Never use broad titles alone. "Director" pulls Directors of every department. Always pair with a function: "Director of Marketing," "VP of Sales," "Head of Operations." |
| Seniority Level | VP, Director, CXO (include Experienced Manager only when brief requires it) | Always exclude Entry Level and In Training. The "Senior" seniority level expands TAM but pulls everything from "Senior Coordinator" to "CEO" — use it only with additional title exclusions. |
| Changed Jobs (Past 90 Days) | Enabled when targeting new decision-makers | People in new roles are 3–5x more likely to evaluate and purchase new solutions in their first 90 days. They're building their stack, proving themselves, and open to conversations. |
| Posted on LinkedIn (Past 30 Days) | Enabled for engagement-based targeting | Active posters are more likely to accept connection requests and respond to outreach. This filter also serves as a proxy for LinkedIn engagement — people who post are people who check their inbox. |
| Function | Specific to persona — Marketing, Sales, Finance, etc. | Exclude at least 5 irrelevant functions per search. Common exclusions: Administrative, Quality Assurance, Military and Protective Services, Community and Social Services, Legal. This is where unqualified prospects slip through. |

### Seniority Level Deep Dive

The Seniority Level filter is one of the most powerful — and most misunderstood — tools in Sales Navigator. Here's how each level actually behaves:

| Seniority Level | What It Actually Pulls | Recommended Action |
|----------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| CXO | C-suite titles (CEO, CTO, CFO, etc.) | Include when targeting executive buyers |
| Owner / Partner | Business owners, managing partners, co-founders | Include when targeting founder-led companies. These contacts often also appear under CXO. |
| Vice President | VP-level titles across all functions | Include for mid-market and enterprise targeting |
| Director | Director-level titles across all functions | Include for most B2B campaigns — Directors often control departmental budgets |
| Experienced Manager | Senior managers with direct reports and budget authority | Include selectively — pulls some qualified buyers but also senior individual contributors |
| Senior | Anything with "Senior" in the title — from Senior Coordinator to Senior VP | Use with extreme caution. Great for expanding TAM but requires additional title exclusions (professor, specialist, coordinator, associate, assistant, student, intern) and manual review of 5+ pages |
| Entry Level Manager | New managers, team leads | Exclude by default unless the brief specifically targets new managers |
| Entry Level | Junior roles, recent graduates | Always exclude |
| In Training | Interns, trainees | Always exclude |

### Mandatory Function Exclusions

Just like industry exclusions, function exclusions push list accuracy from 80% toward 90%+. Exclude every function that would never be your target buyer.

For business/marketing targets, exclude: Administrative, Quality Assurance, Military and Protective Services, Community and Social Services, Accounting, Legal.

For technology targets, exclude: Administrative, Quality Assurance, Military and Protective Services, Community and Social Services, Real Estate, Purchasing.

<Tip>

Most CEOs and Owners show up under the Business Development and Entrepreneurship functions in Sales Navigator — not under the function of the department they oversee. When targeting founders or owners, always include Business Development and Entrepreneurship in your function inclusions, or you'll miss half your target audience.

</Tip>

### Mandatory Title Exclusions

Every search must exclude these 12 titles to prevent junior and irrelevant contacts from contaminating your list:

`intern, assistant, associate, student, coordinator, analyst, unemployed, self-employed, retired, furloughed, seeking, laid off`

If you include the "Senior" seniority level, add two more exclusions: `professor` and `specialist`. The Senior seniority level is the trickiest filter in Sales Navigator — it pulls contacts from "Senior Coordinator" through "CEO" and requires manual review of at least 5 pages deep to catch unqualified matches.

### C-Level Title Coverage

When targeting C-level executives, always include both the abbreviation and the full title. LinkedIn profiles are wildly inconsistent — missing one variation means missing up to half your target list:

| Include Both | And |
|-------------|-----|
| CEO | Chief Executive Officer |
| CTO | Chief Technology Officer |
| CIO | Chief Information Officer |
| CFO | Chief Financial Officer |
| COO | Chief Operating Officer |
| CMO | Chief Marketing Officer |
| CRO | Chief Revenue Officer |
| CHRO | Chief Human Resources Officer |
| CSO | Chief Strategy Officer |

When targeting Director+ level for any function, always include the "Head of" variation. Many senior leaders use "Head of Marketing" instead of "Director of Marketing" or "VP of Marketing." Missing this variation leaves qualified prospects on the table.

<Warning>

The "President" title trap: including "President" as a title inclusion also pulls "Vice President of IT," "Vice President of Marketing," and every other VP variation. If you only want Presidents (not VPs), you must add an exclusion for "vice" in the title filter. Similarly, if your brief targets VPs but not Presidents, be aware that "Vice President" inclusions won't catch profiles that only list "VP" — you need both.

</Warning>

### Seniority + Function Coupling

When the brief is vague about titles (e.g., "anyone in Marketing above Manager level"), use the Seniority Level + Function combination instead of trying to list every possible title. This catches more variations than manual title entry.

Example configuration for "Marketing leaders":
- Seniority: CXO + VP + Director + Experienced Manager + Senior
- Function: Marketing
- Then add title exclusions to clean up the noise that Senior seniority introduces

This approach captures "Director of Demand Gen," "VP of Brand Strategy," "Head of Digital Marketing," and dozens of other variations you'd never think to type manually.

## Boolean Search Strings for 3 Buyer Personas

Boolean search queries the entire LinkedIn profile — current title, past roles, education, summary, and skills. This makes Boolean powerful for niche targeting but imprecise if you're not careful: someone who was a VP of Sales five years ago still matches a "VP Sales" keyword search even if they're now a consultant.

Use Boolean in addition to Sales Navigator filters, never as a replacement. Filters handle current-role targeting; Boolean handles niche refinement and edge cases the filters miss.

### Boolean Syntax Rules

| Operator | What It Does | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `AND` | Both terms must appear somewhere in the profile | `"marketing" AND "director"` |
| `OR` | Either term can appear | `"CEO" OR "founder"` |
| `NOT` | Exclude profiles containing this term anywhere in full profile history | `NOT "recruiting"` |
| `""` | Exact phrase match — required for any multi-word term | `"vice president"` |
| `()` | Group logic like a math equation | `("marketing" OR "sales") AND "director"` |

<Info>

Critical Boolean distinction: `NOT "intern"` in the keyword bar excludes anyone who has EVER been an intern — including someone who interned 15 years ago and is now a VP. For current-role exclusions, use the Title filter instead. Reserve Boolean NOT for terms that indicate permanent unsuitability (like `NOT "recruiting"` to remove career recruiters). Also avoid overly broad NOT exclusions like `NOT "sales"` or `NOT "marketing"` — these remove anyone who mentions those words anywhere in their profile, which is far too aggressive.

</Info>

<Tabs>

  <Tab title="Sales Leaders">

**Target:** VP/Director/Head of Sales at mid-market companies

```
("VP Sales" OR "VP of Sales" OR "Vice President of Sales" OR "Head of Sales" OR "CRO" OR "Chief Revenue Officer" OR "Director of Sales" OR "Sales Director") NOT ("Sales Associate" OR "Sales Rep" OR "Sales Representative" OR "Sales Coordinator" OR "SDR" OR "BDR")
```

**Pair with these filters:**
- Seniority: CXO, VP, Director
- Function: Sales, Business Development
- Headcount: 20–500
- Exclude industries: Staffing and Recruiting, Professional Training and Coaching

**Mentionability check:** "As a sales leader scaling a mid-market team..." — accurate for 80%+ of results.

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Growth / BD Leaders">

**Target:** VP/Head of Business Development or Growth at scaling companies

```
("VP Business Development" OR "VP of Business Development" OR "Vice President of Business Development" OR "Head of Growth" OR "Head of Business Development" OR "Director of Growth" OR "Director of Business Development" OR "Growth Lead") NOT ("Coordinator" OR "Specialist" OR "Associate" OR "Intern" OR "Assistant")
```

**Pair with these filters:**
- Seniority: CXO, VP, Director, Experienced Manager
- Function: Business Development, Marketing, Sales

```

**Pair with these filters:**
- Seniority: CXO, Owner/Partner
- Function: Entrepreneurship, Business Development
- Headcount: 1–10, 11–50, 51–200
- Company Type: Privately Held, Self Owned, Partnership — do NOT include Self Employed

**Mentionability check:** "As a founder building a team past the 10-person mark..." — accurate for 80%+ of results.

## Pre-Built Boolean Templates by Niche

Certain niches require specialized Boolean strings because they don't map cleanly to Sales Navigator's industry taxonomy. These templates have been tested across hundreds of campaigns — copy them directly and adapt as needed:

<Tabs>

  <Tab title="E-Commerce">

```
("ecommerce" OR "e-commerce" OR "internet store" OR "digital store" OR "web store" OR "online shop" OR "digital shop") NOT "agency"
```

Pair with industries: Retail, Retail Apparel and Fashion, Consumer Services, Technology/Internet. The `NOT "agency"` exclusion is critical — without it, every ecommerce marketing agency floods your list.

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="SaaS / Tech Platform">

```
(("platform" OR "SaaS" OR "software as a service" OR "software-as-a-service") AND ("ecommerce" OR "e-commerce" OR "online store")) NOT "recruiting" NOT "staffing" NOT "CRM"
```

Narrow this further by pairing with specific technology stack data from BuiltWith if you're targeting platforms built on Shopify, Stripe, or specific infrastructure.

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="MSPs / Managed Services">

```
("msp" OR "mssp" OR "managed service provider" OR "managed security service" OR "managed security services" OR "managed services provider")
```

MSPs have no direct industry match in Sales Navigator — this Boolean is the primary targeting mechanism. Combine with company name keywords containing "technology," "IT," "solutions," and "systems."

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Restaurants">

```
("restaurant" OR "grill" OR "cafe" OR "steakhouse" OR "bowl" OR "ramen" OR "bbq" OR "deli" OR "wings" OR "pizza" OR "diner" OR "pub" OR "cantina" OR "kitchen" OR "breakfast" OR "coffee" OR "seafood" OR "salad" OR "sushi" OR "burger" OR "chicken" OR "burrito" OR "ice cream" OR "bagels" OR "bakery" OR "tacos") NOT "marketing" NOT "strategy" NOT "cater" NOT "catering" NOT "holding" NOT "holdings" NOT "staffing" NOT "talent" NOT "recruiting" NOT "delivery" NOT "data" NOT "platform" NOT "app" NOT "capital" NOT "equipment" NOT "hotel" NOT "supply" NOT "system" NOT "saas" NOT "technology"
```

Restaurant targeting requires the most aggressive NOT exclusions of any niche. Without them, every restaurant marketing agency, food delivery platform, and restaurant technology company contaminates the list.

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Senior Living">

```
("assisted living" OR "senior care" OR "senior living" OR "nursing home" OR "retirement home" OR "retirement community" OR "senior community")
```

Pair with company name keywords: senior living, senior home, senior community, senior care, retirement living, retirement home, retirement community, assisted living, assisted care.

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Startups (Funding Stage)">

```
(("Startup" OR "start up" OR "start-up" OR "entrepreneur") AND ("series A" OR "pre-seed" OR "seed round" OR "venture backed" OR "seeking funding" OR "raising funds" OR "fundraising"))
```

No funding-stage filter exists in Sales Navigator, so this Boolean is the primary mechanism. Cross-reference results with Crunchbase data for verified funding rounds — the Boolean catches self-reported funding mentions, which may be outdated.

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="AI / ML Startups">

```
("artificial intelligence" OR "ai" OR "analytics" OR "machine learning") AND ("series A" OR "pre-seed" OR "seed round" OR "venture backed" OR "seeking funding" OR "raising funds" OR "fundraising")
```

Combine AI terminology with funding-stage Boolean to isolate funded AI companies from the much larger universe of companies that mention AI in their profiles.

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Manufacturing">

```
("manufacturing" OR "manufacturer" OR "manufacturers")
```

Manufacturing is a broad Sales Navigator industry — use this Boolean to confirm that matched companies actually manufacture products rather than simply serving the manufacturing sector (consultants, staffing firms, IT providers). Pair with company name keywords for sub-niches: "CNC," "injection molding," "steel," "plastics," etc.

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Online Betting">

```
("online betting" OR "bet online" OR "online gambling" OR "sports betting" OR "poker online" OR "online poker" OR "poker app" OR "live betting") NOT "hardware"
```

Niche Boolean for the regulated online gaming space. The `NOT "hardware"` exclusion removes companies selling betting terminals and physical equipment.

  </Tab>

</Tabs>

## Company Name Niche Targeting: The Most Overlooked Power Move

Using the Company filter with niche-specific keywords is the single most effective method for creating clean, tight lists — more effective than industry filters, more precise than Boolean alone. When the target niche has distinctive company naming patterns, this approach produces lists where 90%+ of results are genuine targets, versus 60–70% accuracy from industry filters.

| Niche | Company Name Keywords |
|-------|----------------------|
| Accounting | accounting, accountants, tax, taxes, bookkeeping, CPA, CPAs |
| Airlines/Aviation | airline, airlines, aviation |
| Automotive | motors, group, auto, automotive |
| Banking | bank, banks, credit union |
| Commercial Real Estate | Use Boolean: `(("real estate" OR "realty") AND "commercial")` |
| Construction | construction, contractors, HVAC, heating, cooling, plumbing, plumber, roofing, roofer, landscaping, flooring, painting, painters, electric, electrical, restoration, paving |
| Education | school, institute, college, university, district |
| Engineering | engineering, engineers |
| Events | events |
| Financial Services | capital, financial, lending, lender, credit (exclude "union" if not targeting credit unions), loan |
| Food & Beverage | food, foods, snack, beverage, beverages, distillery, brewing, brewery, liquor, beer, wine, dairy, produce, coffee, water |
| Government | department of |
| Insurance | insurance |
| Legal | law, law offices, LLP, legal |
| Logistics | logistics, supply chain |
| Manufacturing | manufacturing, manufacturer, manufacturers |
| Marketing / Agency | agency, marketing, marketers, advertising, brand, brands, branding, creative |
| Nonprofit | association, charity, foundation |
| Real Estate | real estate, realty, broker, brokers |
| Senior Living | senior living, senior home, senior community, senior care, retirement living, retirement home, retirement community, assisted living, assisted care |
| Solar | solar |
| Staffing | staffers, staffing, recruitment, recruiters, talent, search |

<Tip>

Company name keywords can be combined Boolean-style within the company filter: `("real estate" OR "realty" OR "broker" OR "brokers")`. This is particularly useful for niches where companies use varied naming conventions. For maximum coverage, research how companies in your target niche actually name themselves — industry insider terms that wouldn't occur to an outsider are often the highest-signal keywords.

</Tip>

## Managing List Size: Sales Navigator Limits and Splitting Strategies

Sales Navigator caps visible results at 2,500 prospects (100 pages × 25 per page) and limits filter entries to 232 total (inclusions and exclusions combined). For account lists, you're limited to 1,000 accounts per search and 250 companies per list (requiring approximately 4 lists per search). Understanding these constraints is essential for building complete lists.

### When Lists Are Too Large (10,000+ Results)

A search returning 10,000+ results means your targeting is too broad — but more importantly, you can only ever access the first 2,500. Split into multiple URLs by one of these dimensions:

1. **Geography** — split by region or state (e.g., West Coast vs. East Coast vs. Midwest)
2. **Industry** — split into sub-industries (e.g., Software Development separate from IT Services)
3. **Company size** — split into tiers (11–50 employees vs. 51–200 vs. 201–500)
4. **Seniority** — split C-level from Director-level (these personas need different messaging anyway)

### When Lists Are Too Small

Expand in this order, from least risk to most risk of quality degradation:

1. Add more title variations and "Head of" titles
2. Expand geography (city → metro area → state → multi-state)
3. Add the "Senior" seniority level (with proper title exclusions)
4. Add 3rd-degree connections (last resort — acceptance rates drop significantly)
5. Broaden industry selections

<Warning>

Never pad the list by adding vague filters just to increase volume. It's better to run a smaller, accurate list of 800 contacts than a noisy list of 5,000. Start tight, exhaust the list, then expand methodically. Every expansion step should be followed by a manual quality review of at least 5 pages.

</Warning>

## Difficult-to-Target Niches

Some niches require creative workarounds because Sales Navigator's filter taxonomy doesn't accommodate them directly. Knowing these challenges upfront saves hours of trial and error:

| Niche | Challenge | Recommended Approach |
|-------|-----------|---------------------|
| MSPs / ISPs | No direct industry match in Sales Navigator | Heavy Boolean (`"msp" OR "managed service provider"`) combined with company name keywords ("technology," "IT solutions," "systems") |
| Manufacturing sub-niches | The "Manufacturing" industry is extremely broad — pulls everything from aerospace to food processing | Boolean narrowing with sub-niche terms + company name keywords specific to the sub-niche (e.g., "CNC," "injection molding," "plastics") |
| Startups seeking funding | No funding-stage filter exists in Sales Navigator | Boolean with funding terminology (`"series A" OR "pre-seed" OR "venture backed" OR "seeking funding"`) + cross-reference with Crunchbase data for verified funding rounds |
| Gender-specific targeting | No gender filter exists | Boolean with pronouns (`"She/her" OR "she/hers" NOT "he/him"`) — this method is approximate, not precise, and should be communicated as such |
| Real estate investors | Massive overlap with agents, brokers, and property managers | Boolean + aggressive title exclusions for "agent," "broker," "property manager" + company name targeting for investment-specific firms |

### Niches to Avoid (Consistently Low Accuracy)

These targets produce poor lists regardless of how sophisticated your filtering is — push back when they're requested:

- **Doctors and Dentists** — poor LinkedIn profile completeness, inconsistent titles (MD vs. physician vs. specialist), and extremely low LinkedIn engagement rates for cold outbound
- **Lawyers (for outbound)** — low LinkedIn engagement for cold outreach, heavily gatekept by office managers, and the "Legal" industry filter pulls paralegals and compliance officers alongside actual attorneys
- **C-Level at Fortune 500 companies** — near-zero connection request acceptance rates, multiple layers of gatekeepers, and these contacts receive 50+ outbound messages per week making differentiation nearly impossible

## Common List-Building Mistakes

These are the errors we see most frequently — each one silently degrades list quality and campaign performance:

| Mistake | What Actually Happens | How to Fix It |
|---------|----------------------|---------------|
| No geography selected | Global search pulls contacts from 190+ countries, mostly irrelevant | Always include at minimum United States (or your specific target geography) |
| Relationship filter empty | Pulls your existing 1st-degree connections, who should be contacted through warm outreach instead | Always select 2nd Degree connections |
| Using "Director" alone as a title | Every Director in every department matches — Director of Janitorial Services, Director of Cafeteria Operations | Always pair with a function: "Director of Marketing," "Director of Sales" |
| NOT exclusions in Boolean for current-role terms | Excludes anyone who EVER had that word anywhere in their profile, including 15 years ago | Use the Title filter for current-role exclusions; reserve Boolean NOT for permanently disqualifying terms |
| Forgetting to exclude Staffing & Recruiting industry | Recruiters match nearly every keyword because they mention every industry they recruit for | Add Staffing and Recruiting to industry exclusions on every search (unless that's your target) |
| Not saving search progress | One misclick outside the filter box loses your entire unsaved search with no recovery option | Save after every 20–30 manual entries; use "View All Filters" mode to prevent accidental navigation |
| Clicking a prospect name during build | Navigates away from the search with no back button — your unsaved filters are gone | Always open prospect profiles in a new tab (Ctrl/Cmd+click) during list building |
| Not excluding saved leads and messaged contacts | Re-contacts prospects who have already been saved or messaged, creating duplicate outreach and damaged relationships | Always exclude "All my saved leads" and "Messaged" in every search — these are mandatory filters |

## Multi-Source TAM Building

Sales Navigator is the starting point, not the finish line. The highest-performing lists pull from 4–5 data sources and cross-reference them to build a Total Addressable Market (TAM) that no single tool can match alone. Each source contributes a different intelligence layer — contact data, technographic signals, funding events, or intent indicators.

| Source | What It Contributes | Best For |
|--------|-------------------|----------|
| **Apollo / ZoomInfo** | Verified emails, direct dials, org charts, company firmographics | Core contact data and company enrichment. Apollo covers 275M+ contacts; ZoomInfo is stronger on enterprise org charts and direct phone numbers. Use both in a waterfall — try Apollo first (lower cost per contact), fall back to ZoomInfo for gaps. |
| **Crunchbase** | Funding rounds, investor data, growth signals, founding dates | Identifying recently funded companies (Series A–C), tracking acquisition activity, and filtering by funding stage. A company that closed a $15M Series B last quarter has budget and urgency that a company with no recent funding doesn't. |
| **BuiltWith / Wappalyzer** | Technology stack detection — what tools a company actually runs | Technographic targeting. If your product replaces HubSpot, find every company running HubSpot. If you sell to Shopify merchants, find every site on Shopify. BuiltWith tracks 100,000+ web technologies across 673M+ websites. This data also powers hyper-specific messaging: "I noticed your team runs Outreach and Salesforce..." |
| **Clay** | Workflow orchestration — connects all sources, runs enrichment waterfalls, scores leads | Stitching everything together. Clay pulls from 75+ data providers in sequence, deduplicates, enriches, and outputs a single clean record. It replaces manual spreadsheet merging with automated enrichment chains that run in minutes instead of hours. |

<Tip>

The optimal workflow is: build targeting criteria in Sales Navigator → export to a spreadsheet → run through Apollo/ZoomInfo for contact data → layer Crunchbase for funding signals → overlay BuiltWith for technographics → process everything through Clay for deduplication, scoring, and personalization data. This 5-source approach produces lists where every contact has verified email, company firmographics, technology stack data, and 2–3 personalization hooks before a single email is sent.

</Tip>

## The 9-Step Data Enrichment Process

Raw list exports are never campaign-ready. An unverified list will produce bounce rates above 5%, trigger spam filters, and burn your sending domains. This 9-step enrichment process transforms a raw export into a verified, scored, and personalized campaign list — the difference between a list that generates meetings and one that generates spam complaints.

  <Step title="Email Verification">

Run every email address through a verification tool (NeverBounce, ZeroBounce, or MillionVerifier). Remove any result that comes back as invalid, risky, or unknown. Target a verified rate above 95% — anything below that means your source data is stale. A single campaign sent to 8% invalid addresses can tank your sender reputation for weeks.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Phone Validation">

If your campaign includes cold calling or voicemail drops, validate phone numbers through a service that checks line type (mobile vs. landline vs. VoIP) and connection status. Direct dials convert at 3–5x the rate of main office lines. Remove disconnected numbers and flag mobile numbers separately for SMS-based sequences.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Company Enrichment">

Append firmographic data to every record: employee count, annual revenue, industry classification, founding year, HQ location, and company description. This data powers your segmentation — a 50-person SaaS startup requires fundamentally different messaging than a 500-person manufacturing firm, even if both have a VP of Sales.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Technographic Overlay">

Layer in technology stack data from BuiltWith or Wappalyzer. Identify what CRM, marketing automation, analytics, and infrastructure tools each company runs. Technographic data enables hyper-relevant messaging: "I noticed your team is running Salesforce and Outreach — here's how companies in your space are layering in [your tool] to close the gap between pipeline and revenue."

  </Step>

  <Step title="Intent Signal Check">

Cross-reference your list against intent data providers (Bombora, G2, TrustRadius) to identify which companies are actively researching solutions in your category. A prospect showing high intent — visiting competitor pages, reading category reviews, downloading comparison guides — is 3–7x more likely to take a meeting than a cold contact with no buying signals.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Suppression List Application">

Remove existing customers, active pipeline opportunities, competitors, partners, and any contacts who have previously opted out or marked your emails as spam. This step prevents embarrassing outreach ("Hi, I'd love to tell you about the product you already bought") and protects your sender reputation. Merge your CRM export, past campaign lists, and any client-provided exclusion lists into a single suppression file.

  </Step>

  <Step title="ICP Scoring">

Score every remaining contact against your Ideal Customer Profile using a weighted model. Assign points for firmographic fit (right size, right industry, right revenue), technographic fit (uses complementary or competitive tools), behavioral signals (intent data, LinkedIn activity, job changes), and engagement history (opened previous emails, visited your site). Contacts scoring below your threshold get deprioritized or removed — they dilute your reply rates and waste send volume.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Persona Matching">

Map each contact to a specific buyer persona and corresponding message sequence. A VP of Sales gets different pain points, proof points, and CTAs than a CTO — even at the same company. This step assigns each contact to the right sequence so every email reads like it was written for that person's specific role and challenges, not a generic "decision-maker" template.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Personalization Data Pull">

Extract the specific data points that will power first-line personalization in your outreach: recent LinkedIn posts, company news (funding rounds, product launches, expansions), mutual connections, shared alma maters, technology stack details, and hiring activity. Each contact should have 2–3 usable personalization hooks before it enters a campaign. Personalized first lines increase reply rates by 2–3x compared to generic openers.

  </Step>

## Why List Quality Beats List Size — Every Time

<Info>

500 contacts built from verified intent signals, enriched with technographics, and scored against your ICP will generate more qualified meetings than 10,000 contacts scraped from a single source with no verification. Our campaign data across 200+ B2B engagements confirms this consistently: signal-based lists produce 3–5x more meetings per 1,000 sends. The math is simple — a 12% reply rate on 500 contacts (60 replies) beats a 1.5% reply rate on 5,000 contacts (75 replies) because the 60 replies are 80%+ qualified while the 75 replies are mostly "not interested" and "remove me."

</Info>

The temptation to "just build a bigger list" is the single most common mistake in outbound. Bigger lists mean more generic messaging, lower deliverability (more bounces, more spam complaints), and lower conversion rates at every stage of the funnel. Precision targeting — fewer contacts, better data, more relevant messaging — compounds across the entire pipeline:

- **Deliverability:** Verified lists keep bounce rates under 2%, protecting sender reputation
- **Open rates:** Targeted subject lines to the right persona produce 55–70% open rates vs. 25–35% for generic sends
- **Reply rates:** Personalized outreach to signal-matched contacts generates 8–15% positive reply rates vs. 1–3% for bulk sends
- **Meeting conversion:** Qualified replies from ICP-fit contacts convert to booked meetings at 40–60% vs. 15–25% for unqualified replies

The compounding effect means that a 500-person precision list can produce 20–30 qualified meetings, while a 10,000-person generic list produces 10–15 meetings that are half as likely to close.

## Connecting Targeting to Campaign Execution

Building the list is step one. How that list gets activated — the infrastructure, sequencing, and copy strategy — determines whether your targeting precision translates into pipeline. Explore these guides to see how each piece connects:

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="How many contacts should I include in my first outbound list?">
    Start with 300–500 contacts that are tightly matched to your ICP, fully verified, and enriched with personalization data. This gives you enough volume to generate statistically meaningful results (expect 15–30 positive replies from a well-targeted list at this size) while keeping quality high enough to iterate on messaging. Once you've validated your targeting and sequences with this initial batch, expand to 1,000–2,000 contacts per month with confidence that your filters are producing qualified prospects.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Should I use Sales Navigator or a data provider like Apollo/ZoomInfo?">
    Use both — they serve different purposes. Sales Navigator excels at real-time filtering with the most current LinkedIn profile data (titles, companies, activity), making it the best tool for identifying your target audience. Apollo and ZoomInfo provide verified contact data (emails, phone numbers) and firmographic enrichment that Sales Navigator doesn't offer. The optimal workflow is to build your targeting criteria in Sales Navigator, then pull contact data from Apollo or ZoomInfo, and enrich further with Clay to fill gaps across 75+ data providers.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How accurate are Sales Navigator filters really?">
    Sales Navigator filters are approximately 80–90% accurate on their own. The biggest accuracy issues come from headcount data (companies frequently misreport or omit employee counts), the "Senior" seniority level (which pulls everything from Senior Coordinator to CEO), and industry classifications (many companies are miscategorized). You push accuracy toward 90%+ by layering Boolean keywords, excluding at least 5 irrelevant functions and 5 irrelevant industries, using company name niche keywords, and manually reviewing at least 5 pages of results before launching a campaign.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the difference between 2nd-degree and 3rd-degree connections for outreach?">
    2nd-degree connections consistently produce higher connection request acceptance rates than 3rd-degree connections because mutual connections create implicit trust. Only expand to 3rd-degree when your 2nd-degree list is too small to sustain your campaign volume. Note that Sales Navigator bundles 3rd-degree with all non-1st/2nd connections, so the reported list size can be misleading — many of those "3rd-degree" contacts have no meaningful path back to you.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I target a niche that doesn't map to a Sales Navigator industry?">
    Use company name keyword targeting — it's the most effective method for niche industries that Sales Navigator's industry taxonomy doesn't cover. Search for niche-specific terms in the company name filter: "solar" for solar companies, "HVAC" for HVAC contractors, "msp" for managed service providers. Combine this with Boolean keyword strings in the general search bar. For example, targeting MSPs requires a Boolean like `("msp" OR "mssp" OR "managed service provider" OR "managed services provider")` because there's no MSP industry category in Sales Navigator.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How often should I refresh or rebuild my target list?">
    Refresh your list every 30–60 days. LinkedIn profiles change constantly — people switch jobs, update titles, and move companies. A list that was 90% accurate 60 days ago may be 70% accurate now due to natural contact decay. Each refresh should re-verify emails (expect 2–5% monthly decay), re-check employment status, apply updated suppression lists, and pull fresh intent signals. Building a new list from scratch every quarter ensures your filters and Boolean strings reflect any shifts in your ICP or market.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the most common mistake teams make when building outbound lists?">
    Building lists that are too broad because they prioritize volume over precision. The typical failure pattern is: use broad industry filters, skip Boolean refinement, skip title exclusions, export 10,000 contacts, and wonder why reply rates are under 2%. The fix is to start tight — narrow industry, specific titles, verified signals — validate that the list quality produces qualified replies, then expand methodically. A list where you can write "As a [title] in [industry]..." and have it feel accurate for 80%+ of contacts is a list worth emailing.

# Live Sales Call Execution Playbook

The gap between a good pitch and a closed deal is almost never the content — it's the live execution. The Coat Rack framework gives B2B sales reps a universal 3-step call structure (Pattern Interrupt → Value Bridge → Soft Close) that adapts in real time based on which of 6 buyer archetypes they're facing. Reps who master this system stop running one script and start reading the room, selecting the right selling methodology within the first 90 seconds, and swapping techniques mid-call when signals shift.

## Why Most Call Scripts Fail

A static call script assumes every prospect is the same person having the same day with the same priorities. In practice, a data-driven CFO and an innovation-hungry VP of Product require fundamentally different approaches within the first 30 seconds. The solution isn't "no script" — unstructured calls produce inconsistent results and ramp times that stretch 6 months or longer. The solution is a skeleton that stays constant while everything layered on top adapts.

<Info>

The Coat Rack metaphor: The 1-2-3 call structure (Pattern Interrupt → Value Bridge → Soft Close) is the coat rack — it never changes. The "hats and coats" you hang on it — Challenger Reframes, Sandler Pain Funnels, Belfort Certainty Loops, MEDDIC Discovery, Voss Negotiation Tactics — change based on which prospect archetype you're facing and what signals they give you in real time. Master the rack, then master the wardrobe.

## The 3-Step Call Structure

Every B2B sales call — cold call, discovery, demo, follow-up, negotiation — uses the same skeleton. The substance changes, the structure doesn't.

<Steps>

  <Step title="Step 1: Pattern Interrupt and Attention Lock (First 7 Seconds)">

  You have 7 seconds to earn the next 30. The pattern interrupt breaks the prospect out of autopilot by simultaneously proving you're not reading a generic script, demonstrating you know something specific about their business, and creating a knowledge gap they want filled.

  **Cold call formula:**

  "[Name], this is [your name] with [company]. Before you tell me you're busy — I was looking at [specific thing about their business] and I had a thought about [specific challenge that creates]. Do you have 90 seconds for me to share it? If it's not relevant, I'll get out of your hair."

  **Discovery / video call formula:**

  "Before we dive in, I want to share something I noticed when I was preparing for this call. [Bold observation or reframe about their business they haven't considered]. I think that changes the conversation we're about to have."

  **What makes Step 1 work:** Specificity over generalities. A knowledge gap the prospect wants filled. Permission-based framing (asking for 90 seconds, not 30 minutes). Zero pitching — this is about their world, not yours.

  **Connection to narrative framework:** Your pattern interrupt should be drawn from the Undeniable Shift (Element 1 of the [Sales Narrative Framework](/playbooks/sales-narrative-framework)). The shift in their world IS the most powerful pattern interrupt — it's a change they can't ignore and haven't fully processed.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Step 2: Value Bridge and Emotional Engagement">

  Connect the attention you earned to a specific pain point or opportunity. This is where you transition from interruption to relevance — and this is NOT where you pitch.

  **The bridge formula:** [Their Specific Situation] + [Consequence They Haven't Considered] + [Implied Solution Without Pitching] = Emotional Engagement

  **Value bridge script:**

  "Here's why I bring that up. We've been working with [number] companies in [their industry] and the pattern we keep seeing is [specific pattern]. What that usually means is [consequence they haven't quantified]. And the companies that figured this out are seeing [specific measurable result]. I'm curious — is that consistent with what you're experiencing, or is your situation different?"

  The last question is critical. It invites them to talk, which gives you data for Step 3 and tells you which archetype you're dealing with.

  **Connection to narrative framework:** The value bridge maps directly to Winners/Losers (Element 2) and the Promised Land (Element 3). You're showing the contrast between where they are and where they could be — the Sparkline oscillation in miniature.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Step 3: Soft Close and Engagement Lock">

  You are not asking for the deal. You're locking in the next engagement — a demo, a strategy session, a follow-up with stakeholders, a pilot. No pressure, no urgency tricks, pure value positioning.

  **Primary soft close:**

  "Based on what you've shared, I think there's something specific I can show you that addresses [their stated pain]. Would it make sense to set up [specific next step] where I can walk you through exactly how this would work for [their company]?"

  **Situation-specific alternatives:**

  | Situation | Soft Close |
  |---|---|
  | Engaged but not ready | "What would need to be true for this to make sense for your team? Let me see if I can answer that right now." |
  | Interested but time-pressed | "What if I put together a 5-minute video walkthrough specific to [their situation] and send it over? You can watch it when it works for you." |
  | Additional stakeholders needed | "It sounds like [stakeholder] would want to weigh in. What if I put together a brief specifically for their perspective and we set up a 20-minute call with both of you?" |
  | Lukewarm / testing interest | "I don't want to waste your time or mine. What would you need to see to know whether this is worth 15 more minutes?" |

  **The rule:** Never end a call without a specific next step. Frame every next step as being for them, not for you. "I'd love to set up a demo" loses to "Would it help to see exactly how this would work for your team?" every time.

  </Step>

</Steps>

## The 6 Buyer Archetypes

There are not an infinite number of buyer personality types in a given B2B market. Master these 6 patterns and you can read any prospect within the first 90 seconds of a call — then dress the coat rack accordingly.

### 90-Second Detection Table

| What You Hear in the First 90 Seconds | Archetype | Immediate Adjustment |
|---|---|---|
| "What are the numbers on that?" or "Can you quantify that?" | Analytical | Switch to data-heavy delivery |
| "Just give me the bottom line" or tells you how much time you have | Driver | Compress everything, get direct |
| "Tell me about your team" or asks personal questions | Relational | Slow down, build rapport first |
| "We tried something like this before" or "We've heard this before" | Skeptic | Acknowledge the trust problem, remove risk |
| "That's really exciting" or asks about your roadmap | Visionary | Go bigger, paint the future state |
| "I'd need to loop in my team" or multiple people on the call | Committee | Start mapping stakeholders immediately |

### Archetype Deep Dives

<Tabs>

  <Tab title="The Analytical">

  **Who they are:** Data-driven decision makers. Asks for case studies immediately. Wants ROI calculations. Speaks in metrics.

  **Coat rack adaptation:**
  - Step 1: Pattern interrupt with a surprising industry statistic drawn from the Undeniable Shift
  - Step 2: Value bridge built around quantified cost analysis of the problem
  - Step 3: Soft close offering a custom ROI model or detailed assessment as the next step

  **Primary methods:** MEDDIC (metrics-first), Challenger (data-backed reframe), Hopkins (assumptive close backed by numbers)

  **Narrative emphasis:** Heavy on Evidence (Element 5). They need proof before they'll accept the Promised Land.

  **Avoid:** Emotional appeals, vague promises, round numbers. "About 20%" loses them. "23.4%" earns respect.

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="The Driver">

  **Who they are:** Results-oriented executives. Cut to the chase. Hate small talk. C-suite or VP level. Will tell you how much time you have.

  **Coat rack adaptation:**
  - Step 1: Bold and direct, zero warm-up. "Your competitors are doing X and it's giving them a 23% advantage."
  - Step 2: Compressed — get to the point in under 2 minutes
  - Step 3: Frictionless: "I can show you in 15 minutes. Tuesday or Thursday?"

  **Primary methods:** Belfort Straight Line, Challenger (teach and take control), Sandler (upfront contract on time and next steps)

  **Narrative emphasis:** Compress the full 5-element arc into 5 minutes. They want Shift → Promised Land → Evidence → Offer. Skip nothing, but say it fast.

  **Avoid:** Long stories, excessive rapport building, too many discovery questions before delivering value. Every second of small talk costs you credibility with a Driver.

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="The Relational">

  **Who they are:** Trust-first buyers. Ask about your company culture. Want to know who else you work with. Talk about "fit" and "partnership." Ask personal questions.

  **Coat rack adaptation:**
  - Step 1: Reference a mutual connection or shared experience
  - Step 2: Emphasize partnership and long-term thinking over transaction
  - Step 3: "I'd love to continue this — what does your week look like?"

  **Primary methods:** Relationship-first selling, trust building, conversational and natural delivery

  **Narrative emphasis:** Heavy on the Promised Land (Element 3) as a shared vision. The story is about a partnership, not a purchase.

  **Avoid:** Aggressive closing, competitive positioning that attacks their current vendor, rushing through any section. Relationals who feel pressured disengage permanently.

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="The Skeptic">

  **Who they are:** Risk-averse evaluators. Have been burned before. Question everything. Bring up competitors' failures. Want guarantees.

  **Coat rack adaptation:**
  - Step 1: Acknowledge the industry's trust problem directly. "I know you've probably heard a dozen pitches this month. I'm not going to add to the noise."
  - Step 2: Third-party validation and social proof — let other clients sell for you
  - Step 3: Risk-free next step — pilot, audit, free assessment, month-to-month terms

  **Primary methods:** Sandler Pain Funnel, Hopkins feel-felt-found, Voss labeling to validate concerns, MEDDIC decision criteria mapping

  **Narrative emphasis:** Heavy on Evidence (Element 5) and risk reversal in the Offer. They need to feel that saying yes is safer than saying no.

  **Avoid:** Overselling, dismissing concerns, moving too fast, any hint of pressure. Every time you push a Skeptic, they pull back harder.

  </Tab>

</Tabs>

<Tabs>

  <Tab title="The Visionary">

  **Who they are:** Innovation-hungry leaders. Excited about new approaches. Ask about your roadmap. Talk about disruption, competitive advantage, first-mover positioning.

  **Coat rack adaptation:**
  - Step 1: Paint the future state. "In 18 months, the companies in your space that adopt this will be untouchable."
  - Step 2: Show how current approaches are becoming obsolete — the Undeniable Shift at full power
  - Step 3: Position the next meeting as a co-creation or strategy session, not a demo

  **Primary methods:** Challenger (reframe with a bigger vision), future-state visualization, urgency through vision (not pressure)

  **Narrative emphasis:** Heavy on the Shift (Element 1) and the Promised Land (Element 3). They want the big picture, not the feature list.

  **Avoid:** Getting bogged down in current features, focusing on incremental improvements, being too conservative. Visionaries want to see what's possible, not what's safe.

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="The Committee">

  **Who they are:** Consensus-driven groups. Multiple stakeholders on calls. Decisions require buy-in from several departments. Long evaluation cycles. "I need to check with my team."

  **Coat rack adaptation:**
  - Step 1: Address the shared organizational pain, not individual pain
  - Step 2: Provide materials designed for internal circulation — executive summaries, comparison frameworks, champion toolkits
  - Step 3: Offer to present to the broader team or provide a champion toolkit

  **Primary methods:** MEDDIC (map the entire decision process), Sandler (identify where real power sits), Challenger (arm your champion with reframes they can use internally)

  **Narrative emphasis:** The async version of your deck IS the champion toolkit. The Promised Land must be repeatable in one sentence by your champion to their boss.

  **Avoid:** Trying to close a single person when the decision is group-based, ignoring political dynamics, failing to equip your internal champion with the language and data they need to sell when you're not in the room.

  </Tab>

</Tabs>

## The Methodology Toolkit

Each methodology is a "hat" or "coat" layered onto the coat rack based on the archetype and situation. Reps who master 3-4 methods and learn to swap them mid-call become significantly more effective than single-methodology operators.

### Challenger Reframe (Teach-Tailor-Take Control)

**Best for:** Visionaries, Drivers, and Analyticals who think they already know the answer.

**When to deploy:** When the prospect is comfortable with their status quo and needs their thinking disrupted.

**Script:** "Most [their role] I talk to believe [common industry assumption]. But what we're seeing across [number] companies in [their industry] is actually the opposite. [Surprising insight backed by data]. The companies that figured this out early are seeing [specific measurable result]. What's your take on that?"

### Sandler Pain Funnel

**Best for:** Skeptics and Analyticals who acknowledge a problem but don't feel urgency.

**When to deploy:** When you need to excavate the full cost of inaction.

**Question sequence (weave naturally, don't interrogate):**

1. "Tell me more about [problem they mentioned]."
2. "How long has that been going on?"
3. "What have you tried to fix it?"
4. "And what happened?"
5. "What do you think that's costing you?"
6. "Have you given up trying to fix this?"
7. "How do you feel about that?"

<Warning>

The Pain Funnel excavates pain that already exists — it does not create artificial pain. If the prospect genuinely doesn't have the problem, the funnel will reveal that, and that's valuable information. Forcing pain that isn't there destroys trust and wastes everyone's time.

</Warning>

### Belfort Three Certainties

**Best for:** Drivers who need to feel certain before committing.

**When to deploy:** After the value bridge, when interest is high but hesitation remains.

The prospect needs to score 8+ out of 10 on all three certainties before they'll commit:

| Certainty | What They're Asking | How to Build It |
|---|---|---|
| Product | "Does this actually solve my problem?" | Specific evidence from similar companies, demo moments that mirror their use case |
| You (the rep) | "Do I trust this person?" | Industry knowledge, honest answers to hard questions, acknowledging what you don't know |
| Company | "Will they be around? Will they support me?" | Longevity signals, client retention data, support infrastructure, named contacts |

**Diagnostic question:** "Is it the solution itself you're unsure about, or is it more about whether we're the right team to deliver it?" This question isolates which certainty is low so you can address it directly.

### MEDDIC Discovery

**Best for:** Committee deals with multiple stakeholders and 60-day-plus buying cycles.

**When to deploy:** When the decision is bigger than the person on the phone.

Weave these into natural conversation — never run them as a checklist:

- **M — Metrics:** "What does success look like in numbers for your team?"
- **E — Economic Buyer:** "Who ultimately signs off on investments like this?"
- **D — Decision Criteria:** "What are the must-haves on your evaluation checklist?"
- **D — Decision Process:** "Walk me through how your team typically evaluates and approves something like this."
- **I — Identify Pain:** "What's the biggest thing holding your team back right now?"
- **C — Champion:** "Who on your team is most affected by this and would benefit most from solving it?"

### Voss Negotiation Tactics

**Best for:** All archetypes. Layer into objection handling and rapport building throughout any call.

| Tactic | How It Works | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Mirroring | Repeat the last 1-3 words they said with an upward inflection. Forces elaboration. | Prospect: "We're not sure about the timeline." You: "The timeline?" |
| Labeling | Validate their emotion without agreeing. | "It sounds like you've been burned by agencies that over-promised." |
| Calibrated Questions | "How" and "what" questions that make them solve YOUR problem. | "What would it mean for your team if you could [Promised Land]?" |
| Tactical Empathy | Show you understand their position before asking for anything. | "I imagine this isn't the first pitch you've heard this month." |
| Accusation Audit | Preemptively name the negatives they're thinking. | "You're probably thinking this is just another vendor trying to get a meeting..." |

### Hopkins Trial Close Ladder

**Best for:** Every archetype, every call. Layer these throughout the entire conversation to build "yes momentum."

**Trial close examples to weave in continuously:**

- "That makes sense for your situation, doesn't it?"
- "If we could solve that, would it be worth exploring further?"
- "Is that the kind of result your team is looking for?"
- "Would that be a priority for you this quarter?"

**The Porcupine Technique:** Answer questions with questions that advance the conversation. Prospect: "Does it integrate with Salesforce?" You: "Would Salesforce integration be important for your team's workflow?" This prevents you from giving away information without getting engagement in return.

## Real-Time Coat Swapping

The ability to recognize when something isn't working and switch mid-call separates adaptive closers from script readers. Watch for these signals:

| Signal on the Call | What It Means | Swap To | First Thing to Say |
|---|---|---|---|
| Asks about price before you've established value | Haven't felt enough pain — price is the default when value is unclear | Sandler Pain Funnel | "Before we talk investment — let me make sure this is even relevant. What's [the problem] actually costing you right now?" |
| Goes quiet or gives one-word answers | You're in monologue mode and they've checked out | Value-First or Hopkins Questions | "I realize I've been doing too much talking. Can I ask — what's the biggest thing on your plate right now?" |
| Directly challenges your claims | Analytical testing your data or Skeptic testing your confidence | Challenger Reframe | "That's a fair challenge. Here's what the data actually shows..." Match their energy level. |
| Mentions a competitor by name | Active evaluation mode — you're being commoditized | Belfort + Challenger | Reframe the comparison criteria so you're evaluated on your strengths, not their feature checklist |
| New people join the call unexpectedly | Committee expanded — your pitch to one won't work for three | MEDDIC | "Great to have everyone here. Before I continue — would it help if I understood what each of you is most focused on?" |
| Starts sharing problems unprompted | You hit a nerve — this is the most valuable moment on any call | Sandler Pain Funnel | Do NOT interrupt. Do NOT pitch. Listen, dig deeper, let them talk. Every word is ammunition for your close. |
| Energy drops or call feels like it's dying | Lost relevance or they're multi-tasking | Pattern Interrupt | "Can I be direct with you? I feel like I'm losing you, and I'd rather address what's on your mind than keep going." |
| Gets excited and starts selling internally | Found your champion — don't lose them | MEDDIC | "I can tell this resonates. Who else on your team would need to see this, and what would their biggest question be?" |

<Tip>

The coat swap signal that reps miss most often: the prospect sharing problems unprompted. When someone starts talking about their pain without being asked, most reps interrupt with a pitch because they think they've found the opening. The right move is the opposite — shut up, ask one follow-up question, and let them keep talking. Every sentence they say is data you'll use in the close and in follow-up materials.

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="How long does it take a rep to learn the Coat Rack system?">
    Most reps internalize the 3-step structure (Pattern Interrupt → Value Bridge → Soft Close) within 1-2 weeks of daily practice. Archetype detection takes longer — typically 4-6 weeks of live calls before reps can reliably classify a prospect within the first 90 seconds. The methodology toolkit (Challenger, Sandler, Belfort, etc.) is an ongoing development process — most effective reps master 2-3 methods deeply in their first 90 days, then add 1-2 more per quarter. The real skill isn't knowing every method — it's recognizing when to swap.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if a prospect doesn't fit neatly into one archetype?">
    Most prospects have a primary archetype with secondary tendencies. A CFO might be 70% Analytical and 30% Driver — they want data but they also want you to get to the point. Start with the primary archetype's coat rack adaptation and layer in secondary techniques as the call develops. The 90-second detection is your starting hypothesis, not a permanent classification. Roughly 15-20% of prospects shift archetypes mid-call (often when a new stakeholder joins or when you hit a topic that triggers a different mode). That's what the coat swap system is for.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can this framework work for inbound calls and demos, not just outbound?">
    The structure applies to any live sales conversation. For inbound calls, the pattern interrupt shifts from creating awareness of a new problem to reframing the problem they already know they have — "Most companies that come to us with [their stated need] discover the real issue is actually [deeper insight]." For demos, the coat rack becomes: Step 1 = bold reframe of what they'll see, Step 2 = demo walkthrough anchored to their specific pain (not a feature tour), Step 3 = specific next step. The archetype detection and methodology toolkit work identically regardless of whether the prospect called you or you called them.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I practice coat swapping without live prospects?">
    Role-play with a partner who deliberately switches archetypes mid-conversation. Start the call as an Analytical (asking for data), then shift to a Skeptic (questioning everything) at the 3-minute mark. The rep practices detecting the shift and adjusting in real time. Record these sessions and review the transition moments — most reps take 30-60 seconds too long to recognize the swap signal. Weekly 15-minute role-play sessions with archetype switching produce measurable improvement within 3-4 weeks.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the most common mistake reps make with this system?">
    Over-relying on a single methodology. A rep who's great at Challenger Reframes will try to reframe every prospect, including Relationals who just want to feel heard and Skeptics who interpret reframes as dismissal of their concerns. The second most common mistake is skipping Step 2 (Value Bridge) and jumping straight from the pattern interrupt to a pitch. The value bridge is where you earn the right to close — without it, even a perfect soft close feels premature.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does the pattern interrupt work on cold calls where the prospect is hostile?">
    The 90-second permission frame is specifically designed for hostile or busy prospects. "Before you tell me you're busy" acknowledges their reality. "Do you have 90 seconds? If it's not relevant, I'll get out of your hair" gives them an exit and reduces resistance. On genuinely hostile calls (prospect is angry or rude), deploy the Voss Accusation Audit immediately: "I know this is probably the last thing you wanted to deal with right now, and I may be completely off base — but I noticed something about [their business] that I thought was worth 90 seconds." If they're still hostile after that, end the call respectfully. Not every prospect is worth pursuing, and forcing a hostile call wastes time that could be spent on a receptive one.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does the Coat Rack relate to formal sales methodologies like MEDDIC or Challenger?">
    The Coat Rack is the execution framework — it governs the structure of the call (how you open, bridge, and close). MEDDIC, Challenger, Sandler, Belfort, and the others are methods — they govern what you say within that structure. Think of the coat rack as the operating system and the methodologies as applications. You always run the OS (1-2-3 structure), but you select different applications based on the prospect. MEDDIC runs on the coat rack when you're dealing with a Committee. Challenger runs when you need to reframe a Visionary's thinking. They're not competing frameworks — they're complementary layers.

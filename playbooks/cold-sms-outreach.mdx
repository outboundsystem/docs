# Cold SMS Playbook: The One-Text Framework for B2B Pipeline

Cold SMS works in B2B because 98% of texts get opened and 45% are read within 3 minutes — but only when you treat it as a scalpel, not a shotgun. This playbook covers the complete system: 13 field-tested SMS variations across 5 cold signal segments and 8 warm website-visitor segments, the one-text-per-contact framework that prevents carrier filtering and prospect fatigue, and the response handling scripts that convert replies into booked meetings. Signal-based cold SMS books 8–30 meetings per month at 50 texts per day; RB2B website visitor SMS books 3–10 meetings per month from as few as 50 texts — at 2–3x the response rate of cold segments because the prospect already showed intent.

<Info>

One text per contact. No follow-up texts. Under 160 characters when possible. No links. No pitch. Just a binary question that only your ICP would say "yes" to — then move the conversation to email.

</Info>

## Why Cold SMS Works for B2B

SMS produces 98% open rates and 45%+ read-within-3-minutes rates — numbers that dwarf even the best cold email campaigns, which average 40–60% open rates. The channel works because business decision-makers carry their phones everywhere and read every text, but almost nobody is sending B2B prospecting via SMS. That gap between attention and competition is the entire opportunity.

The constraint that makes it work is also what makes it sustainable: the one-text framework. One message per contact, no follow-up texts, no links (carrier filtering kills SMS with URLs), and no company pitch. The entire message is a hyper-relevant question that qualifies the prospect with a binary yes/no, then moves the conversation to email where you have more room to sell.

**The formula every variation follows:**

> **[Personalized context] + [Binary question that qualifies] + [Low-friction next step]**

"I can send you more info" is the only offer. First name only. Conversational. Like a peer texting — not a brand broadcasting.

<Warning>

Never send links in your first SMS. Carrier filtering algorithms flag URLs aggressively, and your deliverability will crater. The text is a door-opener — email is where you send case studies, calendars, and proof.

</Warning>

## Campaign Architecture

The system runs on two parallel targeting tracks: cold signal-based SMS (prospects identified through hiring activity, funding rounds, tech stack signals, and industry fit) and RB2B website visitor SMS (prospects who already visited your site). Both tracks use the same one-text framework but differ in timing, urgency, and expected response rates.

### Targeting Sources

Four tools feed the prospect pipeline. LinkedIn Sales Navigator builds niche lists by title, company size, and industry. Clay enriches those contacts with real-time signals — funding rounds, hiring activity, tech stack data — and appends verified mobile numbers. Apollo or ZoomInfo serve as secondary mobile number sources when Clay's coverage gaps need filling. RB2B identifies anonymous website visitors by name and company, creating the warmest possible SMS segment.

### Signal-Based Segments

| Segment | Signal | Why They Care |
|---|---|---|
| SaaS companies hiring SDRs | Active SDR job postings | Feeling pipeline pain right now, about to spend $90K+ on a rep |
| Post-Series A/B startups | Funding announcement in last 90 days | Board expects pipeline growth, budget just unlocked |
| Companies with agency in place | Job posts mentioning "agency management" or tech stack showing Instantly/Apollo | Current solution isn't delivering — they're managing it themselves |
| Website visitors (RB2B) | Visited pricing or service pages | Already problem-aware and actively evaluating |
| IT Services / Staffing firms | Revenue $1M–$50M, 10–200 employees | Classic outbound ICP with high LTV and large TAM |

Each segment gets a dedicated SMS variation matched to the specific signal that made them a prospect. A company hiring SDRs gets the "without adding headcount" angle. A recently funded startup gets the "is scaling outbound on the roadmap" question. The signal is the personalization — not the merge field.

## Part 1: Signal-Based Cold SMS (5 Variations)

These variations target prospects based on external signals — hiring activity, funding rounds, existing agency relationships, and industry fit. They're colder than RB2B website visitors but still signal-driven and highly relevant. Expect 8–15% response rates on the conservative end, 15–25% when your signal matching is tight.

### C1: Hiring SDRs Signal

**Who gets this:** Companies with active SDR job postings.

> Hi {first_name}, saw {company} is hiring SDRs. Would you be open to seeing how companies like yours are booking 40+ meetings/mo without adding headcount? Can send over some info if helpful.

~195 characters. References something real they're doing right now. The "without adding headcount" reframes the conversation around their actual goal (pipeline) rather than their assumed solution (hiring). A VP Sales posting an SDR role at $90K+ base salary is already doing the ROI math — this text gives them a reason to pause and evaluate an alternative path.

### C2: Agency-Burned / Switching Signal

**Who gets this:** Companies showing signals of existing agency relationships or DIY tool usage (Instantly, Apollo, or similar platforms in their tech stack).

> Hey {first_name} — quick question. If your current lead gen setup isn't hitting 30+ qualified meetings/mo, would it be worth seeing what's working for other {industry} companies? Happy to send details.

~210 characters. Doesn't trash their current provider — that triggers defensiveness. Instead, it sets a concrete benchmark (30+ qualified meetings per month) that most single-channel agencies can't hit. Lets the prospect self-qualify: if they're already booking 30+ meetings, they'll ignore it. If they're not, the gap between their results and the benchmark does the selling.

### C3: Funded Startup

**Who gets this:** Companies that raised Series A or B in the last 60–90 days.

> Hi {first_name}, congrats on the raise. Quick q — is scaling outbound pipeline on the roadmap this quarter? If so I can send over how other post-Series {A/B} teams are doing it. Just lmk.

~200 characters. Timely — references something real and recent. "Is it on the roadmap" is a natural yes/no that doesn't feel salesy. Post-funding companies have board-level pressure to show pipeline growth and freshly unlocked budget to invest in it. The peer framing ("how other post-Series A teams are doing it") triggers competitive awareness.

### C4: Website Visitor (Quick Version)

**Who gets this:** RB2B-identified visitors who hit pricing or service pages. This is a shorter, more direct version for when you want speed over nuance.

> Hey {first_name} — noticed some interest from {company} in outbound lead gen. Worth sending over a quick breakdown of how we're booking 30–80 meetings/mo for similar {industry} companies?

~195 characters. They already showed intent — this is a warm follow-up, not a cold text. "Noticed some interest" is deliberately vague enough to not feel invasive (no "I saw you on my website at 2:47 PM"). The 30–80 meetings range is specific enough to be credible, broad enough to not oversell.

### C5: Industry-Specific (IT Services / Staffing / SaaS / Cybersecurity)

**Who gets this:** Niche verticals where you have strong case studies and deep ICP knowledge.

> Hi {first_name} — working with a few {industry} companies on outbound right now. Booking 30–50 meetings/mo using AI email + LinkedIn + cold calling. Want me to send over how it works?

~190 characters. Peer proof ("working with a few companies like yours") combined with a specific channel mix and a specific result range. The three-channel mention — AI email, LinkedIn, cold calling — differentiates immediately from single-channel agencies. Binary ask keeps it clean.

## Part 2: RB2B Website Visitor SMS (8 Variations)

These are your warmest possible SMS leads. They've already visited your site, looked at your pages, and left. The text isn't cold — it's a well-timed tap on the shoulder. Expect 2–3x the response rates of any cold segment.

<Info>

RB2B typically identifies 5–15% of your traffic. At 1,500–3,000 monthly visitors, that's 75–450 identified visitors. After ICP filtering (title, company size, revenue), you'll have 20–100 textable contacts per month. Send within 1–4 hours of the visit — same-day is mandatory.

</Info>

### R1: The Soft Acknowledgment

**Best for:** Service page visitors. Feels natural, not invasive.

> Hey {first_name} — saw some interest from {company} in outbound lead gen. Would it be worth sending over how we're booking 30–80 meetings/mo for similar {industry} companies? Happy to share if helpful.

~190 characters. "Saw some interest from {company}" is deliberately vague — doesn't say "I tracked you on my website." Feels like a referral or a signal from their activity in the market. The 30–80 meetings range is specific enough to be credible, broad enough to not oversell. "Happy to share if helpful" is zero-pressure.

### R2: The Niche Case Study Drop

**Best for:** Visitors who hit an industry-specific page or case study page. Leverages peer proof.

> Hi {first_name} — we just helped a {industry} company go from 0 to 40+ qualified meetings in 6 weeks using AI outbound. Curious if that's relevant for {company}? Can send the breakdown.

~185 characters. Leads with a specific, real result — grounded in actual case studies of companies going from zero outbound to 40+ meetings in 6 weeks. "Curious if that's relevant" is low-pressure and lets the prospect self-qualify. "Send the breakdown" offers more info, not a call.

### R3: The Problem-First Hook

**Best for:** Visitors who browsed multiple service pages (email + LinkedIn + calling pages) — signals they're evaluating solutions.

> Hey {first_name}, quick q — is {company} looking to scale outbound without adding SDRs? If so, I can send over how our clients are replacing reps and booking 30+ meetings/mo. Just lmk.

~195 characters. "Without adding SDRs" speaks to the real pain — they don't want to hire a $90K–$120K rep and wait 3–4 months for ramp. The replacement angle is one of the strongest differentiators for outsourced outbound. "Just lmk" is casual and binary.

### R4: The Agency-Burned Angle

**Best for:** Visitors who hit "How It Works" or comparison pages — signals they're evaluating against alternatives they've already tried.

> Hi {first_name} — if {company} has tried outbound agencies before and been underwhelmed, worth seeing how we're different? Month-to-month, full transparency, 86K+ meetings booked. Can send details.

~195 characters. Goes straight at the number-one objection: past agency disappointment. The proof stack is compressed but potent — month-to-month (risk reversal), full transparency (addresses the black-box complaint), 86K+ meetings booked (volume credibility). "Can send details" keeps it binary.

### R5: The Speed Angle

**Best for:** Pricing page visitors — highest intent. They're comparing costs and timelines.

> Hey {first_name} — most of our clients are live and booking meetings within 14 days. If {company} needs pipeline fast, I can send over how it works and a few results from {industry}. Worth a look?

~195 characters. Pricing page visitors are evaluating feasibility — cost and timeline are the two variables they're solving for. "14 days" addresses the timeline concern directly. "Needs pipeline fast" qualifies for urgency. This is your closest-to-buying segment, so the speed angle matches their decision stage precisely.

### R6: The Multi-Channel Differentiator

**Best for:** Visitors who looked at cold email OR cold calling pages specifically — they're thinking single-channel.

> Hi {first_name} — most {industry} companies we work with see 2–3x more meetings when they combine AI email + LinkedIn + cold calling vs. one channel. Want me to send over how it works for {company}?

~200 characters. Directly challenges the single-channel thinking that likely burned them with their last agency. The "2–3x more meetings" claim is backed by performance data across thousands of campaigns. Positions the full system as the answer to their fragmented approach.

### R7: The ROI Math Angle

**Best for:** Pricing page visitors or return visitors — they're doing the math in their head already.

> Hey {first_name} — our avg client books 30–50 meetings/mo at $120–$200 per meeting. If that math works for {company}, I can send a quick breakdown + a couple {industry} case studies. Interested?

~195 characters. Gives them the numbers they're trying to figure out. Cost per meeting is the metric VP Sales and CEOs actually calculate against SDR costs ($90K+ salary divided by meetings booked produces ugly math for in-house). Letting them run the ROI in their head does the selling.

### R8: The Competitive Displacement

**Best for:** Visitors who hit your site from a competitor comparison search or viewed comparison content.

> Hi {first_name} — a lot of the {industry} companies we work with switched from single-channel agencies and saw 2–4x more pipeline with our AI email + LinkedIn + calling approach. Want me to send over a comparison?

~205 characters. Doesn't name the competitor directly — keeps it professional — but "switched from single-channel agencies" calls out exactly what competing shops do. "2–4x more pipeline" is a credible range backed by multi-channel vs. single-channel performance data. Offering a comparison document is high-value, low-commitment.

## Page-to-Variation Matching Guide (RB2B)

Match the right RB2B variation to the page(s) the visitor viewed. The page they spent time on tells you their mindset — match the message to where they are in the evaluation process.

| Page(s) Visited | Best Variations | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Pricing page | R5 (Speed), R7 (ROI Math) | Highest intent — they're evaluating cost and feasibility |
| Service page (single) | R1 (Soft), R2 (Case Study) | Exploring — give them peer proof without pressure |
| Multiple service pages | R3 (Problem-First), R6 (Multi-Channel) | Evaluating scope — show the full system advantage |
| How It Works / Comparison | R4 (Agency-Burned), R8 (Competitive) | Comparing alternatives — differentiate hard |
| Case study page | R2 (Case Study), R7 (ROI Math) | Proof-hungry — feed them more results |
| Blog / content pages | R1 (Soft), R3 (Problem-First) | Early stage — soft touch, qualify interest |
| Return visitor (any page) | R5 (Speed), R4 (Agency-Burned) | Multiple visits signal real intent — push toward action |

<Tip>

When a visitor hits multiple page types in one session, prioritize the highest-intent page they viewed. Pricing page trumps blog. Comparison page trumps service page. Match the variation to their peak intent, not their entry point.

</Tip>

## Response Handling Scripts

These scripts apply to both cold signal-based SMS and RB2B SMS. The number-one rule: respond within 5 minutes to any positive reply. Speed-to-lead data consistently shows that response rates drop by 80%+ after the first 5 minutes.

<Steps>

  <Step title="Positive Reply — 'Yes' / 'Sure' / 'Send it over'">

  Reply immediately:

  > Great — just sent you a quick email at {first_name}@{domain} with a breakdown and a couple case studies from {industry}. Let me know if it doesn't come through.

  Then immediately send a personalized email (not a template blast) with a 2–3 sentence intro referencing the SMS exchange, one relevant case study matched to their niche, and a soft CTA: "Worth a 15-min call to see if this maps to {company}? Here's my calendar: [link]." The email is where you sell — the text was just the door-opener.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Soft Decline — 'Not right now' / 'Maybe later'">

  > No worries at all. Mind if I check back in a couple months?

  Add to your warm database for re-engagement in 60–90 days via email or LinkedIn. A "not now" is not a "no" — it's a timing issue. These contacts convert at 10–15% when re-engaged at the right moment.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Skeptical Reply — 'Who is this?' / 'How did you get my number?'">

  > Hey — this is {your_name} with Outbound System. We help B2B companies book qualified meetings through AI-powered outbound. Totally understand if it's not a fit, just thought it might be relevant based on {signal}. Happy to remove you from any future messages.

  Professional, transparent, no defensiveness. About 20–30% of "who is this" replies convert to interest after this response — the question often indicates curiosity, not hostility.

  </Step>

  <Step title="No Response">

  Do NOT follow up via SMS. One text — that's the rule. Add non-responders to your [cold email sequences](/services/cold-email) or [LinkedIn outbound](/services/linkedin-outbound) instead. Different channel, different approach, same prospect.

  </Step>

</Steps>

## Timing and Execution Rules

### RB2B Website Visitor Timing

Send within 1–4 hours of the visit. Same-day is mandatory — next-day follow-up drops response rates by 40–60%. If RB2B fires at 11 PM, queue the text for 9–10 AM the next morning. The intent signal is still warm enough within 12 hours, but sending at midnight will get you blocked and reported.

### Cold Signal-Based Timing

Send between 9–11 AM in the recipient's local time zone — this is the highest response window for cold B2B SMS. Pull 30–50 contacts per day from signal-based lists (Clay enriched). Match each contact to the right SMS variation based on their signal before sending.

### Universal Rules

Only text during business hours: 8 AM – 6 PM in the recipient's local time zone. One text per contact — no follow-up SMS under any circumstances. Non-responders go into email and LinkedIn sequences. Send in small batches of 30–50 per day to avoid carrier filtering. Monitor responses in real-time and reply within 5 minutes to any "yes." Log all responses: "Yes" triggers an email follow-up, "Not now" goes into the warm database, and no response enters email/LinkedIn sequences.

### Daily Workflow: Cold SMS

<Steps>

  <Step title="Pull 30–50 contacts from a signal-based list (Clay enriched)">

  Filter for verified mobile numbers, ICP title match, and a fresh signal (job posting live, funding in last 90 days, tech stack match).

  </Step>

  <Step title="Match each contact to the right SMS variation based on their signal">

  Hiring SDRs → C1. Agency signals → C2. Recent funding → C3. Industry fit → C5. Use the signal-to-variation mapping table.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Personalize merge fields">

  Fill {first_name}, {company}, {industry}, and any signal-specific fields. Read the message out loud — if it sounds robotic, rewrite.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Send between 9–11 AM in recipient's local time zone">

  Stagger sends across the batch. Do not blast 50 texts at 9:00 AM sharp — space them over the 2-hour window.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Monitor responses in real-time">

  Reply within 5 minutes to any positive response. Use the response handling scripts above.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Log all responses and outcomes">

  Track sends, responses, response type (yes/no/not now/who is this), email follow-ups sent, and meetings booked. This data feeds your A/B testing.

  </Step>

</Steps>

### Daily Workflow: RB2B SMS

<Steps>

  <Step title="RB2B identifies visitor and pushes data to Clay or your CRM">

  This happens automatically via webhook or native integration.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Clay enriches with title, company size, industry, and mobile number">

  Enrichment should fire within minutes of the RB2B identification event.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Filter for ICP match">

  Only text contacts matching your ICP — VP Sales, CEO, CRO, Head of Growth at companies with $50K+ monthly revenue. Non-ICP visitors get added to email nurture, not SMS.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Match the SMS variation to the page they visited">

  Use the page-to-variation matching guide. Pricing page → R5 or R7. Service page → R1 or R2. Multiple pages → R3 or R6.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Personalize and send within 1–4 hours of the site visit">

  Use Salesmsg or OpenPhone. If the visit was after hours, queue for 9–10 AM the next morning.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Monitor and respond within 5 minutes to any positive reply">

  RB2B contacts convert at 2–3x the rate of cold contacts — speed matters even more here.

  </Step>

</Steps>

## Tech Stack and Workflow

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **RB2B** | Website visitor identification for warm SMS — identifies 5–15% of traffic by name and company |
| **Clay** | Enrich contacts with real-time signals (funding, hiring, tech stack, title, mobile number) |
| **Apollo / ZoomInfo** | Verified mobile numbers when Clay's coverage has gaps |
| **LinkedIn Sales Navigator** | Build niche prospect lists by title + signal, verify ICP fit before enrichment |
| **Salesmsg or OpenPhone** | Compliant SMS sending with opt-out management and delivery logging |
| **Instantly or HubSpot** | Email follow-up after "yes" replies — this is where you send the case study and calendar link |
| **Google Sheet or CRM** | Track sends, responses, conversions, and revenue per text sent |

The workflow is linear: identify prospect (Sales Nav + Clay or RB2B) → enrich and verify mobile (Clay + Apollo) → match to SMS variation → send via compliant platform → handle response → move to email for conversion. Total time per contact: 2–3 minutes for cold, under 1 minute for RB2B with automation.

## Compliance Requirements

<Warning>

TCPA violations carry penalties of $500–$1,500 per text. This is not an area to improvise. Consult a TCPA attorney before scaling past initial testing volumes.

</Warning>

B2B texts to business numbers are generally permissible under the TCPA's B2B exemption, but state laws vary — Florida, Washington, and Oklahoma have stricter rules that may require additional consent documentation. Follow every requirement below without exception:

Use a compliant sending platform — OpenPhone, Salesmsg, or Heymarket — never your personal phone. These platforms handle opt-out management, delivery logging, and compliance documentation automatically.

Always include opt-out ability. If someone says "stop" or "remove me," comply immediately and log it. There is zero tolerance for continued contact after an opt-out request.

Run all numbers against national and state Do Not Call registries before sending. Your enrichment tool (Clay or Apollo) should flag DNC numbers during the enrichment step — verify this is configured.

Only send during business hours in the recipient's time zone: 8 AM – 6 PM local. Time zone violations are among the most common TCPA complaints.

No automated mass blasts. Send in small batches of 30–50 per day using manual or semi-automated workflows. This also prevents carrier filtering, which throttles or blocks high-volume SMS senders.

Maintain records of all sends and opt-outs for at least 4 years. Your sending platform should handle this automatically, but verify that records are exportable and complete.

## Expected Performance Benchmarks

### Cold Signal-Based SMS (50 texts/day, 5 days/week)

| Metric | Conservative | Strong |
|---|---|---|
| Response rate | 8–15% | 15–25% |
| "Yes" / interested rate | 3–6% | 6–12% |
| Meetings booked (monthly) | 8–15 | 15–30 |

### RB2B Website Visitor SMS (20–100 texts/month after ICP filtering)

| Metric | Conservative | Strong |
|---|---|---|
| Response rate | 15–25% | 25–40% |
| "Yes" / interested rate | 6–12% | 12–20% |
| Meetings booked (monthly, from 50 texts) | 3–6 | 6–10 |

RB2B visitors outperform cold segments by 2–3x on response rate because they already showed intent by visiting your site. The gap between "conservative" and "strong" comes down to three factors: signal quality (how well your targeting matches the variation), speed (RB2B texts sent within 1 hour vs. 4 hours), and personalization depth (generic industry mention vs. company-specific observation).

<Tip>

Combine cold SMS with your [cold email](/services/cold-email) and [LinkedIn outbound](/services/linkedin-outbound) sequences for maximum coverage. Prospects who receive your text, then see your email, then get a LinkedIn connection request convert at significantly higher rates than any single-channel approach — the multi-touch effect produces 2–3x more meetings across thousands of campaigns.

</Tip>

## A/B Testing Priority

Test in phases. Each phase should run for a minimum of 2 weeks at 50 texts per day before drawing conclusions — anything less and your sample size is too small for reliable signal.

### Phase 1: Find the Winning Angle

**Cold SMS:** Test C1 (Hiring SDRs) vs. C2 (Agency-Burned) vs. C5 (Industry-Specific) — these represent three fundamentally different signals. Find which signal-to-variation match produces the highest positive response rate in your market.

**RB2B SMS:** Run R1 (Soft Acknowledgment) vs. R4 (Agency-Burned) vs. R7 (ROI Math) — three different psychological triggers (curiosity vs. pain vs. logic). The winner often varies by industry and deal size.

### Phase 2: Optimize Delivery

Test timing windows: 9–10 AM vs. 11 AM–12 PM vs. 2–3 PM for cold SMS. For RB2B, test within 1 hour vs. 2–4 hours after the visit. Day of week also matters — Tuesday through Thursday typically wins for B2B SMS, but test Monday and Friday before eliminating them.

### Phase 3: Refine Targeting

Test specificity level (generic industry mention vs. company-specific observation), CTA framing ("Want me to send info?" vs. "Worth a quick look?" vs. "Open to seeing how?"), and for RB2B, whether page-specific variations outperform sending a single "best" variation to everyone regardless of the page visited.

**The metric that matters:** Track response rate, positive response rate, meetings booked, and revenue per text sent. Optimize for revenue per text sent — that's the number that compounds.

## Quick Reference: All 13 SMS Variations

| R2 | Niche Case Study Drop | RB2B | Industry/case study page | Specific result + "send the breakdown" |
| R3 | Problem-First Hook | RB2B | Multiple service pages | "Scale without adding SDRs" |
| R4 | Agency-Burned Angle | RB2B | How It Works / comparison pages | Month-to-month + 86K meetings |
| R5 | Speed Angle | RB2B | Pricing page (highest intent) | "Live and booking in 14 days" |
| R6 | Multi-Channel Differentiator | RB2B | Cold email or calling pages | "2–3x more meetings" vs. single channel |
| R7 | ROI Math Angle | RB2B | Pricing page / return visitors | Cost per meeting math |
| R8 | Competitive Displacement | RB2B | Competitor comparison search | "Switched from single-channel agencies" |

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="Is cold SMS legal for B2B prospecting?">
    B2B texts to business numbers are generally permissible under the TCPA's B2B exemption, but state laws vary. Florida, Washington, and Oklahoma have stricter rules that may require additional consent. Use a compliant sending platform (OpenPhone, Salesmsg, Heymarket) that handles opt-out management and logging automatically. Run all numbers against DNC registries before sending. Consult a TCPA attorney before scaling past testing volumes — violations carry $500–$1,500 penalties per text.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why only one text per contact with no follow-up?">
    One text per contact protects you on three fronts. Compliance: multiple unsolicited texts increase legal exposure. Deliverability: carriers filter senders who blast sequences, throttling or blocking your number. Reputation: a single well-crafted text feels like a peer reaching out — a sequence of 3–5 texts feels like spam. Non-responders go into email and LinkedIn sequences where follow-up is expected and less invasive.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What response rate should I expect from cold B2B SMS?">
    Cold signal-based SMS produces 8–15% response rates conservatively, 15–25% when your signal matching is tight. RB2B website visitor SMS outperforms at 15–25% conservative and 25–40% strong, because the prospect already showed intent by visiting your site. The gap between conservative and strong comes down to signal quality, send speed (especially for RB2B — within 1 hour vs. 4 hours), and personalization depth.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does RB2B website visitor SMS work?">
    RB2B identifies anonymous website visitors by matching their browsing session to publicly available identity data — typically capturing 5–15% of your traffic. When a visitor matches your ICP (title, company size, revenue), their data flows to Clay for enrichment, which appends a verified mobile number. You then send the appropriate SMS variation matched to the page they visited within 1–4 hours. The result is a "warm" text to someone who was just evaluating your solution — producing 2–3x the response rate of cold SMS.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What tools do I need to run cold SMS campaigns?">
    The core stack is five tools: RB2B for website visitor identification, Clay for signal enrichment and mobile number verification, LinkedIn Sales Navigator for building cold prospect lists, a compliant SMS platform (Salesmsg or OpenPhone) for sending with opt-out management, and your email tool (Instantly or HubSpot) for follow-up after positive replies. Apollo or ZoomInfo serves as a backup mobile number source. Total monthly cost for the stack runs $500–$1,200 depending on volume and tool tiers.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Should I include links in my cold SMS?">
    No — never include links in your first SMS. Carrier filtering algorithms flag URLs aggressively, and your deliverability will drop significantly. The text message is a door-opener that earns permission to send more info. Once you get a positive reply, you move the conversation to email where you can include case studies, calendar links, and detailed breakdowns without deliverability risk.

  <Accordion title="How do I combine SMS with cold email and LinkedIn outbound?">
    SMS works best as a parallel channel, not a replacement. Cold SMS contacts who don't respond get added to your email and LinkedIn outbound sequences — different channel, different approach, same prospect. For RB2B visitors, the SMS goes out within 1–4 hours while the email sequence starts 24–48 hours later. Prospects who see your text, then receive your email, then get a LinkedIn connection request convert at significantly higher rates than any single-channel approach. See our [cold email service](/services/cold-email) and [LinkedIn outbound service](/services/linkedin-outbound) for how the full multi-channel system works.

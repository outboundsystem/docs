# Reporting & Dashboards

Outbound System clients get real-time dashboard access to every metric that matters — sends, opens, replies, meetings booked, and pipeline value — plus weekly analyst reports that explain what the numbers mean and what changes are being made. You never wait for a monthly PDF to find out if your campaigns are working.

## What Metrics Are Tracked?

Every stage of the outbound funnel is measured, from first send through closed revenue. The dashboard tracks activity metrics (volume and velocity), engagement metrics (prospect responses), and outcome metrics (meetings and pipeline). Here's the full breakdown:

| Metric Category | What's Tracked | Why It Matters |
|----------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Activity** | Emails sent, LinkedIn connections sent, calls made, follow-ups completed | Confirms volume targets are hit — a typical campaign sends thousands of touches per month across channels |
| **Deliverability** | Inbox placement rate, bounce rate, spam complaints, domain health scores | A 2% drop in deliverability can cut reply rates in half; this catches problems before they compound |
| **Engagement** | Open rates, reply rates, positive reply rates, connection acceptance rates, LinkedIn message replies | Separates signal from noise — a 45% open rate means nothing if the reply rate is 1% |
| **Meetings** | Meetings booked, meetings held, no-show rate, meeting source attribution | The number that matters most; dashboard shows meetings booked in real time with prospect name, title, and company |
| **Pipeline** | Opportunities created, pipeline value, stage progression, closed-won revenue | Connects outbound activity directly to revenue so you can calculate true ROI |
| **Calling** | Total calls, connect rate, positive intent rate, average call time, callbacks scheduled | For clients using cold calling, every call is logged with outcome disposition and time metrics |

<Info>

The dashboard updates in real time. When a prospect replies or a meeting is booked, it appears in the Live Activity feed within minutes — not at the end of the week. One client dashboard sample shows 9,247 total calls with a 42% connect rate and 34 meetings booked, all visible at a glance with trend indicators comparing to prior periods.

## What Does the Dashboard Look Like?

Clients access a dedicated dashboard that shows campaign performance across every active channel. The interface is organized into four main sections:

**Top-line KPIs** display the numbers that matter most — total outreach volume, connect or reply rates, positive intent percentage, meetings booked, and average engagement time. Each KPI includes a trend indicator (e.g., "↑12% vs last week" or "↑5.1% this month") so you can see directional movement without digging into charts.

**Active Campaigns** breaks performance down by campaign. If you're running three campaigns — say, Enterprise SaaS targeting CFOs, Mid-Market targeting VP Sales, and a New Vertical test in Fintech — each one shows its own calls/sends, connect rate, intent rate, and meetings booked. This makes it immediately clear which campaign is producing and which needs adjustment.

**Live Activity** is a real-time feed showing exactly what's happening: "Meeting booked — Sarah Chen, VP Eng @ Stripe — 2m ago" or "Positive intent — Marcus Webb, CFO @ DataStack — 8m ago." No waiting for a report. No wondering if anything is happening.

**Channel Analytics** for LinkedIn outreach tracks connections sent, connections accepted (with acceptance rate), messages sent, message replies (with reply rate), and InMail performance — all plotted on a time-series chart so you can see engagement trends day by day.

<Tip>

Every conversation is recorded, transcribed, and searchable. You can search calls by keyword, outcome, or objection type. Transcripts and meeting details link automatically to the right contact in your CRM with zero manual data entry.

## Reporting Cadence and Format

Outbound System delivers reporting at three cadences, each serving a different purpose:

<Steps>

  <Step title="Real-Time Dashboard (Always On)">

    The client dashboard is accessible 24/7. Every metric updates as activity happens. This is your "check anytime" view — no need to email your account manager to ask how things are going. The dashboard includes the lead management inbox where all replies are sorted, labeled, and handed off.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Weekly Performance Report (Every Monday)">

    A written report delivered by your campaign strategist covering the prior week's performance. This is not a data dump — it includes three sections: (1) what happened (metrics with context), (2) what it means (analysis of trends, reply sentiment, objection patterns), and (3) what we're changing (specific optimizations being made this week). A typical weekly report identifies 2-3 actionable changes based on the data.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Monthly Strategy Review (First Week of Each Month)">

    A 30-minute call with your strategist reviewing month-over-month trends, pipeline attribution, ICP refinement opportunities, and forward planning. This is where larger strategic shifts happen — new verticals to test, messaging pivots based on 4+ weeks of data, and scaling decisions for campaigns that are producing.

  </Step>

</Steps>

## How Reporting Drives Optimization Decisions

Data without action is a PDF that gets filed and forgotten. Every metric tracked in the dashboard connects to a specific optimization lever:

**Reply rate drops below 2%** → triggers a messaging audit. The team reviews reply sentiment, tests new subject lines or opening angles, and checks deliverability metrics to rule out inbox placement issues. Most reply rate problems are diagnosed and fixed within one weekly cycle.

**Connect rate on calls exceeds 40% but meeting conversion lags** → signals a script or qualification problem. Call recordings are reviewed for objection patterns, and the talk track is revised. The dashboard's conversation analysis identifies competitor mentions and sentiment signals across calls, turning raw conversations into strategic intelligence.

**One campaign outperforms another by 2x on meetings booked** → the underperforming campaign's targeting, messaging, and channel mix are compared against the winner. Winning patterns (specific job titles, company sizes, or message angles) get replicated. The Active Campaigns table makes this comparison instant — you can see that an Enterprise SaaS campaign targeting CFOs booked 18 meetings from 3,847 calls while a Mid-Market campaign targeting VP Sales booked 12 from 4,112 calls.

**LinkedIn acceptance rate exceeds 33% but message reply rate is low** → indicates the connection request copy is working but the follow-up sequence needs revision. Channel analytics showing connections accepted vs. messages replied isolates exactly where the drop-off occurs.

<Warning>

Agencies that only report monthly are hiding 3-4 weeks of underperformance. If a campaign has a deliverability issue in week one, monthly reporting means it runs broken for a full month before anyone notices. Real-time dashboards plus weekly analyst reports catch problems in days, not months.

</Warning>

## CRM Integration and Data Flow

Dashboard data doesn't live in isolation. Direct CRM integration pushes replies, meeting bookings, and pipeline updates straight into your existing system. When a prospect replies positively or a meeting is confirmed, the record is created or updated in your CRM automatically — no manual data entry, no lost leads between systems.

The smart inbox chat consolidates all prospect communication in one place. Rather than digging through multiple email accounts and LinkedIn inboxes, every reply is sorted, labeled by sentiment (positive, neutral, objection, not interested), and queued for handoff to your sales team.

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="Can I access the dashboard myself, or do I have to wait for reports?">
    You have 24/7 access to your own dashboard. It updates in real time as activity happens — sends, replies, meetings booked, and live activity all appear as they occur. The weekly and monthly reports supplement this with analysis and recommendations, but you never have to wait to see your numbers.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What does a weekly report actually include?">
    Each weekly report covers three sections: what happened (metrics with trend comparisons to prior weeks), what it means (analysis of reply patterns, objection themes, and engagement trends), and what's changing (specific optimizations being implemented that week). It's written by your campaign strategist, not auto-generated from a template.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How quickly can I see if a campaign isn't working?">
    Within days, not weeks. The real-time dashboard shows engagement trends as they develop, and your strategist monitors these metrics continuously. If deliverability drops, reply rates decline, or a new campaign underperforms in its first week, the team flags it in your weekly report with a corrective plan — or reaches out sooner if the issue is urgent.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does reporting integrate with my CRM?">
    Yes. Direct CRM integration pushes positive replies, meeting bookings, and pipeline updates into your existing system automatically. Contact records are created or updated without manual data entry. The dashboard also includes a lead management inbox where all replies are sorted and labeled for easy handoff to your sales team.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What metrics should I actually care about vs. vanity metrics?">
    Meetings booked and pipeline value are the metrics that matter. Open rates and send volume are activity indicators — useful for diagnosing problems but not measures of success on their own. A 60% open rate with a 0.5% reply rate means your subject lines work but your messaging doesn't. The dashboard tracks everything, but your strategist focuses the weekly report on the metrics tied to revenue outcomes.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How is call performance tracked and analyzed?">
    Every call is recorded, transcribed, and searchable by keyword, outcome, or objection type. The dashboard shows total calls, connect rate, positive intent rate, average call time, and meetings booked per campaign. Beyond raw metrics, conversations are analyzed for objection patterns, competitor mentions, and sentiment signals — giving you strategic intelligence, not just call logs.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I see performance broken down by individual campaign or channel?">
    Yes. The Active Campaigns section shows each campaign's performance independently — outreach volume, connect/reply rate, intent signals, and meetings booked. LinkedIn analytics are separated with their own metrics (connections sent, acceptance rate, message replies). This granularity lets you and your strategist see exactly which campaigns and channels are driving results and which need adjustment.

# Al-Air & Electrical — 14x ROI

Al-Air went from zero outbound property management contracts to 3 closed deals generating recurring revenue in just 2 months. The shift was positioning: instead of bidding as another vendor, outreach led with operational pain — emergency HVAC failures, tenant turnover costs, reactive vs. preventative maintenance — and positioned Al-Air as a partner who reduces 2 AM phone calls.

## The Challenge

Al-Air needed to break into the Florida property management market but had no systematic way to reach decision-makers who control HVAC maintenance contracts. Property managers don't have time for sales pitches — they're managing tenant complaints, vendor no-shows, and maintenance backlogs. Standard vendor outreach gets buried.

Cold calling without targeting, generic vendor pitches positioning Al-Air as another contractor bidding on one-off jobs — none of it addressed the real pain property managers feel daily.

**Before Outbound System:**
- Zero property management contracts from outbound
- No systematic pipeline for recurring revenue accounts
- Generic vendor positioning competing on price alone
- No targeting strategy for high-value property portfolios

**After Outbound System:**
- 17 qualified leads in 2 months
- 3 new property contracts closed (recurring revenue)
- Positioned as maintenance partner, not one-off vendor
- Site visits conducted with multiple potential clients

## The Solution

Outreach acknowledged property managers' reality: they're overwhelmed and need solutions, not pitches. Messaging led with operational pain and positioned Al-Air as a partner who reduces emergency calls through preventative maintenance programs. Prospect lists were filtered by portfolio size across Florida.

### Cold Email

Sequences hitting decision-makers at the start of the week when facility planning happens. Targeted property managers across Florida, filtered by portfolio size, with messaging around preventative maintenance ROI.

### LinkedIn Outreach

Engaged property managers with content relevant to facility operations and vendor management, building credibility in the commercial HVAC space before the direct ask.

### AI Cold Calling

Direct touchpoint for larger property management companies, using brief scripts focused on preventative maintenance ROI and cost comparison between reactive calls and scheduled programs.

### Beyond the Meetings

- **Market Intelligence:** Campaign data revealed property managers overseeing 50+ unit complexes responded at 2x the rate of smaller portfolios, indicating the strongest fit for Al-Air's maintenance programs.
- **Pipeline Insurance:** Multi-channel coverage (email, calling, LinkedIn) meant property managers who ignored emails during busy mornings still received AI calls mid-week.
- **ICP Refinement:** Short-term rental managers in vacation-heavy Florida markets showed higher urgency than apartment managers, leading to faster close cycles and higher contract values.
- **Recurring Revenue:** Every closed account represents recurring monthly maintenance revenue. The 3 contracts will generate ongoing cashflow for years beyond the initial campaign investment.

# Brandetize — 1,326% ROI

Brandetize spent $5,400 over 3 months and generated $77,000 in revenue — a 1,326% ROI — by targeting coaches at a specific inflection point: generating revenue but hitting a ceiling because their marketing was DIY or managed by generalist freelancers. 7 clients closed from 22 meetings with 69 qualified responses per month.

<Info>

**$5,400 invested. $77,000 in revenue. 7 clients closed. 69 responses/month.** Stage-specific targeting at the growth ceiling inflection cut through competing agency noise.

## The Challenge

The coaches-and-consultants market is oversaturated with agency pitches. Every coaching inbox is full of "scale your business" promises. Brandetize needed outreach that cut through the noise from competing agencies all saying the same thing.

Broad coaching market outreach without stage-specific targeting or revenue-outcome-anchored messaging meant Brandetize's pitch blended into a wall of generic agency noise.

**Before Outbound System:**

- Generic "scale your coaching business" messaging
- No stage-specific targeting at revenue inflection points
- No revenue outcome proof from comparable clients
- Lost in the noise of competing agency pitches

**After Outbound System:**

- 7 new clients converted in 3 months
- 69 qualified responses per month on average
- Stage-specific targeting at growth ceiling inflection
- Every closed deal a positive experience from first touch

## The Solution

Six-source verified lists targeted coaches at a specific inflection: generating revenue but hitting a ceiling because their marketing was DIY or managed by generalist freelancers. Enterprise infrastructure maintained deliverability into Gmail and Google Workspace.

### Cold Email

Primary channel with messaging built around growth metrics from similar clients: specific revenue increases, audience growth rates, and launch results. Anchored to specific outcomes like "here's what happened when a leadership coach with $200K annual revenue went through our program."

### LinkedIn Outreach

Strong secondary channel. Engaging with prospects' content and building familiarity before email sequences hit, creating warm recognition.

### AI Cold Calling

Reserved for high-ticket coaching businesses where potential contract value justified a direct conversation about growth ceiling and marketing infrastructure.

### Beyond the Meetings

- **Market Intelligence:** Stage-specific targeting (revenue + ceiling signals) proved dramatically more effective than broad coaching market outreach.
- **ICP Refinement:** Coaches with $100K-$300K annual revenue and DIY marketing showed the highest conversion — budget to invest plus clear pain from marketing limitations.
- **Full-Journey Quality:** Every closed deal was reported as a positive experience from first touch to signed contract.

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="How did Brandetize cut through the saturated coaching agency market?">
    Stage-specific targeting. Instead of pitching all coaches, messaging targeted those at a specific inflection: generating revenue but hitting a ceiling because marketing was DIY. This specificity meant outreach named the exact problem the prospect was experiencing, separating it from generic "scale your business" noise.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What growth ceiling signals identified the right coaches?">
    Revenue generation combined with marketing limitation indicators: DIY marketing setup, generalist freelancers handling campaigns, same launch numbers for 6+ months, audience growth plateaus. These signals indicated coaches ready to invest in professional marketing.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why did 69 responses per month translate to only 22 meetings?">
    69 qualified responses included positive replies, follow-up questions, and engagement signals. The 22 meetings represent fully qualified, booked conversations. A high response-to-meeting ratio is normal — many responses need nurturing before they convert to a scheduled call.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What revenue level of coaches converted best?">
    Coaches generating $100K-$300K annually. Below $100K, budget for marketing services is limited. Above $300K, many already have agency relationships. The $100K-$300K range represents coaches with proven revenue who feel the ceiling most acutely.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How is the $77,000 revenue figure verified?">
    Cash collected from 7 closed clients within the 3-month campaign. $77,000 from $5,400 spend equals a 14.26x return, or 1,326% ROI. Revenue reflects actual payments received, not contract value.

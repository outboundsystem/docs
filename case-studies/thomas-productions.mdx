## The Challenge

Real estate brokerages and PE firms invest heavily in property presentation but still rely on photography and static virtual tours. Thomas Productions needed to reach buyers before they defaulted to existing vendors — and convince them that video production isn't a cost center but a revenue accelerator.

Standard video production pitches describe capabilities. The missing connection was between professional video and measurable business outcomes: fewer days on market and higher closing prices. Capabilities-focused outreach was failing to earn attention from real estate decision-makers.

**Before Outbound System:**

- Capabilities-focused pitches failing with real estate buyers
- No connection between video and measurable sales outcomes
- No systematic targeting of premium brokerages and PE firms
- Existing vendor relationships blocking new conversations

**After Outbound System:**

- 52 meetings booked in 4 months
- 37% reply rate from real estate decision-makers
- Video positioned as faster sales cycles and higher returns
- Prospects converting because value tied to their revenue model

## The Solution

Prospect lists targeted real estate brokerages handling premium listings and PE firms with active real estate portfolios. Messaging was structured around a specific outcome: properties with professional video sell faster and close higher — not around production quality or creative capabilities.

### Cold Email

Sequences included examples from comparable brokerages showing reduced days-on-market and higher closing prices when video was part of the listing strategy. Not selling production. Selling faster sales and higher returns.

### LinkedIn Outreach

Targeted managing brokers and marketing directors, engaging with their property posts and sharing video production insights demonstrating understanding of the luxury real estate market.

### Beyond the Meetings

- **Market Intelligence:** Response data revealed that managing brokers at luxury brokerages responded at 2x the rate of marketing directors, indicating the decision-maker who truly controls vendor selection.
- **Pipeline Insurance:** Email and LinkedIn in parallel ensured that even busy brokers who miss emails during showing season saw Thomas Productions through LinkedIn engagement.
- **ICP Refinement:** Brokerages handling \$1M+ listings showed dramatically higher engagement than those focused on mid-market, validating the premium positioning strategy.

<Tip>
  Tying video directly to days-on-market reduction and closing price increases means prospects converted because the value proposition matched their revenue model exactly. Creative capabilities become a secondary conversation once the business case is established.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why did reframing video as a revenue tool matter?">
    Real estate brokers and PE firms evaluate every investment through an ROI lens. "Professional video production" sounds like a cost. "Properties with video sell 20% faster and close at higher prices" sounds like a revenue investment. The reframe shifted video from the marketing budget to the revenue-generation category, earning attention from decision-makers who otherwise ignore vendor pitches.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why did managing brokers respond better than marketing directors?">
    Managing brokers at luxury brokerages control vendor selection for their listings directly. Marketing directors may manage the relationship, but the managing broker makes the actual decision to invest in video for a specific property. Targeting the true decision-maker — not the coordinator — produced 2x the response rate.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What listing price range responded best?">
    Brokerages handling \$1M+ listings showed dramatically higher engagement than mid-market brokerages. At the luxury level, the cost of professional video is negligible relative to listing value, and the competitive differentiation from static photography is most visible. The ROI case is strongest where the delta between a faster sale and a slower sale represents tens of thousands in carrying costs.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How did the 37% reply rate compare to other creative services campaigns?">
    Thomas Productions' 37% reply rate is among the highest across all 44 campaigns. For context, the median reply rate across all campaigns is in the 4-8% range for cold email. The 37% reflects the power of revenue-tied messaging — when prospects can immediately see how a service connects to their bottom line, response rates climb dramatically.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What was the cost per meeting and ROI breakdown?">
    Cost per meeting was $138 — well below the $200 median across all 44 campaigns. Each $138 meeting generated an average of $2,000 in revenue ($104,000 / 52 meetings). The $7,200 total investment returned \$104,000, making this one of the most efficient creative services campaigns in the portfolio.

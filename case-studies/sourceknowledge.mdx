# SourceKnowledge — 13.6x ROI

SourceKnowledge went from lost in the "better ROAS" noise to 70 booked meetings and an inbox so full of leads that follow-up capacity became the bottleneck — not lead generation. Vertical-specific platform comparisons against Meta and Google did the heavy lifting: fashion buyers saw fashion ROAS data, DTC consumables buyers saw consumables data. Generic "better performance" claims got replaced with numbers media buyers could evaluate against their own dashboards.

## The Challenge

Retail marketing leaders are bombarded with "better ROAS" promises from every ad platform. SourceKnowledge needed proof specific enough to make a media buyer stop scrolling — not generic benchmarks, but vertical-specific ROAS comparisons showing exactly where SourceKnowledge outperformed Meta and Google in specific retail categories.

Generic ad platform positioning without vertical-specific performance comparisons against the incumbent platforms prospects already used was getting buried in ad tech noise.

**Before Outbound System:**
- Generic "better ROAS" positioning lost in ad tech noise
- No vertical-specific performance comparisons vs. Meta/Google
- No systematic outbound to retail media buyers
- Single-channel outreach missing decision-makers

**After Outbound System:**
- 70 meetings booked in 8 months
- 31 qualified responses per month on average
- Vertical-specific ROAS data displacing incumbent platforms
- Follow-up capacity became the bottleneck, not lead gen

## The Solution

Prospect lists targeted retail brands with aggressive paid acquisition budgets actively scaling spend on Meta and Google. Messaging led with vertical-specific ROAS figures showing where SourceKnowledge outperformed incumbents in fashion, home goods, and DTC consumables — numbers media buyers could evaluate against their own performance dashboards.

### Cold Email

Sequences with platform comparison data: not generic benchmarks but vertical-specific ROAS figures against Meta and Google. Fashion brands saw fashion data. DTC consumables brands saw consumables data. Each email gave media buyers something to check against their own numbers.

### LinkedIn Outreach

Targeted media buyers and heads of growth with personalized connection requests referencing the prospect's specific ad activity and vertical, creating familiarity before the platform comparison email arrived.

### AI Cold Calling

Direct channel for high-spend retail brands, using brief scripts leading with the specific ROAS delta in the prospect's retail vertical. A 60-second call about category-specific performance converted interest into meetings.

### Beyond the Meetings

- **Market Intelligence:** Campaign data mapped which retail verticals had the highest dissatisfaction with incumbent platforms, giving SourceKnowledge competitive intelligence for product positioning.
- **Pipeline Insurance:** Multi-channel meant even if an email got buried, LinkedIn kept SourceKnowledge visible in the prospect's feed, preventing lost opportunities.
- **ICP Refinement:** DTC consumables brands showed the highest response to platform comparison data, while fashion brands responded more to creative capability messaging, enabling per-vertical optimization.
- **Capacity-Driven Growth:** 31 replies/month generated a high-quality problem: the bigger challenge became follow-up capacity, not lead generation.

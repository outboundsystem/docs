# Doxicom — 12.3x ROI

Doxicom closed 3 deals in 2 months with an 80% response rate from delivered leads — the highest response rate across all 44 campaigns.

## The Challenge

Selling waste recycling solutions requires reaching the intersection of operational decision-making and sustainability commitment — two priorities that live in different parts of most organizations. Operations people respond to cost savings. Sustainability people respond to environmental impact. Both need to be reached with their native messaging, and the order matters.

Single-message-track outreach that didn't differentiate between operations and sustainability buyer priorities or test which framing converted better was underperforming.

**Before Outbound System:**
- No dual-audience messaging framework
- Single message track for different buyer types
- No intent signals for sustainability commitment
- Limited targeting of multi-location prospects

**After Outbound System:**
- 3 deals closed in 2 months
- 81 qualified responses per month on average
- 80% response rate from delivered leads
- Cost-first then sustainability messaging proven as superior framework

## The Solution

Outreach identified companies where operational and sustainability priorities had converged: businesses with public sustainability pledges, ESG reporting, or environmental initiative announcements. A dual proof framework tested cost savings vs. environmental impact, finding cost-first consistently outperformed sustainability-first messaging.

### Cold Email

Dual proof framework: hard cost savings from waste diversion (operations language) alongside measurable environmental impact metrics (sustainability board report language). A/B testing proved cost-first converted better across all segments.

### LinkedIn Outreach

Parallel channel engaging sustainability leaders active in ESG-focused groups and industry discussions, building credibility in the sustainability space before the direct ask.

### AI Cold Calling

Deployed for multi-location prospects where contract value justified a direct conversation. A 60-second call highlighting cost savings from comparable implementations converted interest into meetings.

### Beyond the Meetings

- **Market Intelligence:** The dual-framework test definitively proved cost-first messaging outperforms sustainability-first, providing Doxicom with a validated go-to-market narrative for all channels.
- **Pipeline Insurance:** Three-channel coverage reached both operations and sustainability leaders within the same organization through their preferred channels.
- **ICP Refinement:** Companies with public ESG commitments showed 2x the engagement rate, as organizational mandate to evaluate waste solutions created receptive buyers.
- **Exceptional Response Quality:** 80% response rate from delivered leads indicated targeting and messaging were reaching exactly the right people with exactly the right message.

## The Challenge

Every inbox is full of "we'll 10x your leads" promises from marketing agencies. Maverick needed specificity, not a louder version of the same pitch everyone else sends. Selling marketing services to business owners who've been burned by agencies is one of the hardest outbound motions in B2B — prospects are skeptical, fatigued, and quick to delete anything generic.

Broad outreach without vertical segmentation, generic positioning, and no systematic testing of which verticals converted fastest had produced no predictable outbound pipeline.

**Before Outbound System:**
- No predictable outbound pipeline
- Generic agency positioning lost in crowded inboxes
- No vertical-specific proof points in outreach
- No data on which segments had shortest path to close

**After Outbound System:**
- 37 qualified meetings in 6 months
- 6 closed deals from outbound pipeline
- 10+ high-intent leads per month consistently
- Vertical-specific ROAS data driving targeting decisions

## The Solution

Outreach was segmented by vertical (senior living, landscaping, home services) with custom messaging for each. The first 30 days tested subject lines and CTAs by segment aggressively to identify which verticals had the shortest path to close, then volume was reallocated to the winners.

### Cold Email

Vertical-specific sequences with free audit offers backed by actual ROAS numbers from comparable clients. Senior living owners heard about occupancy rates. Landscaping owners heard about seasonal lead flow. Each vertical received its own proof framework.

### LinkedIn Outreach

Targeted the same business owners with content-driven engagement tailored to their vertical challenges, warming prospects before the email ask arrived.

### AI Cold Calling

Supplemented email for home services prospects, where phone responsiveness tends to be higher than email engagement. Brief scripts referencing the prospect's specific trade and market.

### Beyond the Meetings

- **Market Intelligence:** First-30-day testing revealed senior living facilities had 2.3x the response rate of home services, despite home services being the initial priority. This data-driven pivot dramatically improved ROI.
- **Pipeline Insurance:** AI calling covered home services where email engagement was lower, ensuring no segment went dark due to channel preference mismatch.
- **ICP Refinement:** Free audit offers converted better in senior living, while case study CTAs worked better for landscaping, enabling per-vertical CTA optimization.
- **Warm Database:** 10+ high-intent leads per month created a compounding warm database for re-engagement as Maverick expanded service offerings.

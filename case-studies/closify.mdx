# Closify — 1,339% ROI

Closify spent $19,800 over 11 months and generated $285,000 in revenue — a 1,339% ROI — by letting the math do the selling. Commission-only closers vs. traditional sales hiring costs: once agency owners saw the economics, skepticism melted. 95 meetings at $208 each with 52 qualified responses sustained monthly across nearly a year of campaigning.

**$19,800 invested. $285,000 in revenue. 95 meetings. 52 responses/month for 11 months.** Economics-driven messaging overcame "too good to be true" skepticism at scale.

## The Challenge

Agencies need sales talent but hate recruiting. The commission-only model sounds too good to be true until you see the economics. Outreach had to overcome that skepticism with proof.

Standard SaaS outreach described the model without breaking down the specific cost comparison against traditional sales hiring and management expenses. Commission-only closers sound like a gimmick to agencies burned by bad hires.

**Before Outbound System:**

- Commission-only model dismissed as "too good to be true"
- No cost-comparison framework showing hiring economics
- No targeting based on agency growth and hiring signals
- No sustained pipeline for ongoing agency market penetration

**After Outbound System:**

- 95 meetings booked over 11 months
- 52 qualified responses per month on average
- Economics-driven messaging overcoming skepticism
- Sustained pipeline reflecting the model's fundamental appeal

## The Solution

Six-source verified prospect lists targeted growing agencies adding service lines, expanding client rosters, or posting sales roles. Messaging was structured around specific economics: in-house vs. Closify cost comparison.

### Cold Email

Primary channel with messaging structured around hiring economics: what it costs to hire, train, and manage an in-house sales rep versus deploying a commission-only closer, with results from comparable agencies.

### LinkedIn Outreach

Supplemented email by engaging agency founders' content on growth, hiring, and sales challenges.

### AI Cold Calling

Targeted agencies at the largest scale, where a brief conversation about current sales hiring costs could quickly establish model fit.

### Beyond the Meetings

- **Market Intelligence:** Agency growth signals (new service lines, expanding rosters, sales role postings) proved reliable predictors of model fit.
- **ICP Refinement:** Agencies with 10-30 employees actively posting sales roles showed the highest conversion — acute hiring pain with limited recruitment budget.
- **Economics as Proof:** Letting the math do the selling overcame skepticism more effectively than any testimonial or case study.

  <Accordion title="How did economics-based messaging overcome skepticism?">
    Commission-only sounds too good to be true. The messaging broke down the specific math: what agencies spend to hire, train, ramp, and manage an in-house sales rep ($75K-$120K/year) versus deploying through Closify. When the cost comparison is laid out clearly, the economic advantage is undeniable.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How was 52 responses/month sustained for 11 months?">
    Three factors: continuous list refreshment through growth signal monitoring (agencies are always entering and exiting hiring phases), A/B testing of messaging variants, and enterprise infrastructure maintaining deliverability over the long campaign duration without degradation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What agency size responded best?">
    Agencies with 10-30 employees actively posting sales roles. This size has acute sales hiring pain (growing fast enough to need help) but limited budget for traditional recruitment and full-time salary commitments. The commission-only model directly addresses their constraint.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why was this an 11-month campaign?">
    Closify's model has ongoing appeal as agencies constantly enter growth phases. The sustained 52 responses/month and consistent meeting quality justified continuous investment. Long campaigns compound — warm databases from earlier months re-engage as agencies' needs evolve.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How is the $285,000 revenue verified?">
    Cash collected from deals closed through the 11-month campaign. $285,000 from $19,800 spend equals a 14.39x return, or 1,339% ROI. Revenue reflects actual money received across the full engagement period.

# Automation Anywhere — 2,331% ROI

Automation Anywhere spent $7,200 over 4 months and generated $175,000 in revenue — a 2,331% ROI — by replacing cold calling with systematic outbound prospecting led by senior leaders. 35 meetings with enterprise buyers at $206 each, generating 48 qualified responses monthly. The campaign became a permanent complement to the internal team.

**$7,200 invested. $175,000 in revenue. 48 responses/month.** Campaign adopted as a permanent complement to the internal team — not a one-time engagement.

## The Challenge

Enterprise RPA sales cycles are long, complex, and involve multiple stakeholders. Traditional SDR cold calling lacked the credibility and targeting precision needed for enterprise automation conversations with senior operations leaders.

Conversations needed to start at C-suite and VP operations levels with prospects in industries where automation ROI is most dramatic. Standard SDR outreach didn't match the enterprise buying process.

**Before Outbound System:**

- Traditional cold calling underperforming at enterprise level
- Conversations starting too low in the organization
- No industry-specific automation ROI proof in outreach
- SDR approach lacking credibility for senior-level engagement

**After Outbound System:**

- 35 meetings in 4 months with enterprise buyers
- 48 qualified responses per month on average
- Senior-leader-led outbound replacing cold calling
- Campaign adopted as permanent complement to internal team

## The Solution

Prospect lists targeted companies with operational complexity and manual process bottlenecks in financial services, healthcare, manufacturing, and logistics. Messaging led with implementation-specific ROI from enterprises of comparable size and complexity.

### Cold Email

Led with implementation-specific proof: not "automation saves time" but specific ROI metrics from enterprises of comparable size and complexity. Sequences engaged C-suite and VP-level operations leaders.

### LinkedIn Outreach

Built visibility at senior leadership level through executive engagement and thought leadership content on operational transformation.

### Beyond the Meetings

- **Market Intelligence:** Financial services and healthcare had the shortest path from first conversation to pilot engagement, prioritizing these verticals.
- **ICP Refinement:** Mid-campaign pivot from SDR outreach to senior-leader-led prospecting yielded significantly higher-quality conversations.
- **Permanent Integration:** The campaign framework was adopted as a permanent complement to the internal team, validating long-term strategic value.

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="Why did senior-leader-led outbound outperform SDR cold calling?">
    Enterprise automation buyers evaluate vendors at a strategic level. When outreach comes from or references senior leadership, it signals a peer-level conversation about operational transformation rather than a sales pitch. The mid-campaign pivot to this approach yielded significantly higher conversation quality and close rates.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What industries showed the strongest results?">
    Financial services and healthcare had the shortest path from first conversation to pilot engagement. Both industries have high volumes of manual processes with clear automation ROI, making the business case self-evident once the right stakeholder is in the conversation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why was the campaign made permanent?">
    The systematic outbound framework consistently produced 48 qualified responses monthly at the enterprise level — something the internal team's cold calling approach hadn't achieved. The campaign proved sustainable enough to warrant permanent adoption as a pipeline channel.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How did the campaign reach C-suite buyers?">
    Enterprise Azure infrastructure ensured deliverability past corporate email filters. LinkedIn executive engagement built visibility before email outreach. Implementation-specific ROI data (not generic automation benefits) earned attention from senior operations leaders.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How is the $175,000 revenue verified?">
    Cash collected from enterprise deals closed through the campaign over 4 months. $175,000 from $7,200 spend equals a 24.31x return, or 2,331% ROI.

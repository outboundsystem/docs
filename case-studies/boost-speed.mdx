Boost Speed spent \$5,400 over 3 months and generated \$54,000 in revenue — a 900% ROI — by turning generic site speed pitches into firm-specific diagnostics. CPA firm partners responded at a 26% rate because each email felt like a professional assessment, not a sales blast. 9+ qualified leads per week consistently, with 36 meetings at \$150 each.

  **\$54,000 in revenue. 9+ leads/week. 26% reply rate.** Framing each email as a professional diagnostic rather than a pitch earned consistent weekly pipeline.

## The Challenge

CPA firms know their websites are slow, but they rarely prioritize fixing them because the connection between site speed and client acquisition feels abstract. Generic "your site is slow" messaging doesn't create urgency.

CPA firm partners needed to see the specific revenue impact of their firm's site performance to justify the investment. Standard outreach without firm-specific diagnostic data or revenue impact calculations failed to motivate action.

**Before Outbound System:**

- Generic "your site is slow" messaging creating no urgency
- No firm-specific diagnostic data in outreach
- No revenue impact calculations tied to individual firms
- Standard infrastructure missing Microsoft-heavy accounting inboxes

**After Outbound System:**

- 9+ qualified leads per week consistently
- 26% reply rate from CPA firm partners and directors
- Firm-specific diagnostics making each email feel personal
- High-level executive connections across accounting vertical

## The Solution

Six-provider verified prospect lists targeted CPA firm partners and marketing directors, focusing on firms with established web presences measurably underperforming: slow load times, poor mobile scores, and page speed metrics correlating with lost search visibility.

### Cold Email

Led with firm-specific observations: "your site loads in X seconds. Here's what that's costing you in organic traffic and potential client inquiries." Personalization turned a generic pitch into a professional diagnostic.

### LinkedIn Outreach

Targeted managing partners with engagement on practice growth and client development content, building credibility in the accounting space.

### AI Cold Calling

Follow-up channel for firms that engaged with emails but didn't book. A brief call walking through revenue impact of site performance converted interest to meetings.

### Beyond the Meetings

- **Market Intelligence:** The average CPA firm website loads 2-3x slower than benchmark, quantifying the market opportunity for Boost Speed's services.
- **ICP Refinement:** Firms with 10-50 employees showed highest conversion — large enough for meaningful traffic but often lacking dedicated IT resources.
- **Diagnostic-as-Outreach:** Framing each email as a professional assessment earned 9+ leads weekly by providing value before asking for anything.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How did firm-specific diagnostics earn a 26% reply rate?">
    Each email referenced the prospect's actual site performance: load time, mobile score, and estimated traffic impact. CPA firm partners responded because the email felt like a professional assessment they would have paid for, not a sales blast. Providing value in the first touch is the fastest path to a conversation.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What size CPA firms responded best?">
    Firms with 10-50 employees showed the highest conversion rates. They're large enough to have meaningful web traffic and client acquisition goals but typically lack dedicated IT resources to diagnose and fix site performance issues independently.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How was 9+ leads per week sustained over 3 months?">
    Continuous list refreshment targeting CPA firms by performance metrics (not just demographics), combined with AI calling to convert email-engaged firms that hadn't booked. The diagnostic approach maintained consistent engagement because each email was uniquely personalized.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why was AI calling important for this audience?">
    CPA firm partners who opened the diagnostic email but didn't respond often needed a brief, direct conversation walking through the revenue impact to convert. A 60-second call referencing their specific site data bridged the gap from interest to booked meeting.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How is the $54,000 revenue calculated?">
    Cash collected from deals closed through the 3-month campaign. $54,000 from $5,400 spend equals a 10x return, or 900% ROI. Revenue reflects actual money received, not contract value.

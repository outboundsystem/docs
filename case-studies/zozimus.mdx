## The Challenge

Zozimus had marquee clients (Toast, GoToMeeting) and proven results including campaigns that doubled demo requests and landed TechCrunch coverage. But outbound fell into the trap most agency messaging does: listing services instead of leading with outcomes marketing leaders actually care about. Marquee credentials sat unused in outreach that blended into agency noise.

Service-list-focused outbound that didn't leverage marquee client results or peer comparison frameworks to drive conversations had left pipeline underdeveloped relative to the caliber of work Zozimus delivered.

**Before Outbound System:**
- Outbound messaging didn't match caliber of work
- Service-list approach lost in agency noise
- Marquee client results (Toast, GoToMeeting) underutilized
- No peer comparison framework in messaging

**After Outbound System:**
- 46 qualified responses per month
- 30 meetings in 3 months with B2B tech marketing VPs
- Prospects arriving pre-educated on Zozimus's value
- "Companies like yours" framework driving conversions consistently

## The Solution

Target lists focused on marketing VPs at high-growth B2B tech companies resembling Zozimus's best clients. Messaging used the "companies like yours" framework: showing results from comparable companies and letting prospects draw the conclusion. No service lists. Just outcomes — demo pipeline growth, press coverage, and brand velocity.

### Cold Email

Primary channel with sequences leading with demo pipeline growth, press coverage, and brand velocity — the metrics marketing leaders actually measure and care about. No capability descriptions, just proof from peers.

### LinkedIn Outreach

Reinforced messaging by engaging prospects' content and sharing relevant case study insights that built familiarity before the meeting ask. Marketing VPs saw Zozimus in their feed before seeing the email.

### AI Cold Calling

Targeted marketing VPs at the highest-growth companies with brief scripts anchored to specific results from comparable clients. A 60-second call referencing their peer's results opened doors email alone couldn't.

### Beyond the Meetings

- **Market Intelligence:** The "companies like yours" framework revealed which company profiles had the strongest pattern recognition response, refining Zozimus's ideal client profile based on engagement data.
- **Pipeline Insurance:** Three-channel coverage meant even marketing VPs who filter vendor emails aggressively still encountered Zozimus through LinkedIn and AI calling.
- **ICP Refinement:** Series B-C stage companies with 100-500 employees had the highest meeting conversion rate, narrowing targeting for maximum efficiency.
- **Pre-Educated Prospects:** 46 responses per month meant prospects arrived to first calls already understanding the value, compressing sales cycles and improving close rates.

# Manifaith — 50.7x ROI

Manifaith turned a client roster featuring Nike, Turo, and Vogue into $93,000 in pipeline in a single month. Premium credentials sat unused while competitors with weaker portfolios booked projects simply because they were visible at the right moment. The fix: time outreach to when production decisions are actively being made, and structure every email as a mini-case study instead of a capability pitch.

## The Challenge

Video production is a crowded market, but Manifaith had something most competitors didn't: Nike, Turo, and Vogue on the client roster. The challenge was getting that credibility in front of buyers before they defaulted to existing vendors. Premium credentials were sitting unused while competitors with weaker portfolios booked projects because they were visible at the right moment in the buying cycle.

Reliance on existing relationships and inbound inquiries — no systematic outbound targeting event planners and corporate experience coordinators when production decisions were being made.

**Before Outbound System:**
- No systematic outbound despite premium client roster
- Reliant on inbound and existing relationships
- Brand-name portfolio (Nike, Turo, Vogue) underutilized in prospecting
- No timing alignment with prospect decision cycles

**After Outbound System:**
- 23 qualified leads in a single month
- $93,000 in pipeline generated
- Outreach timed to active production decision windows
- Mini-case-study sequences driving bookings without full presentations

## The Solution

Outreach was timed to when production decisions were actively being made. Lists were built around upcoming event calendars and corporate experience programs. Each email was a mini-case study — giving prospects enough proof to take the meeting without requiring a full presentation first.

### Cold Email

Messaging led with the brand-name portfolio but hooked with specificity: not "we do video" but "here's what we produced for a comparable event type and the engagement metrics it drove." Each sequence provided enough proof to earn the meeting in 3 sentences.

### LinkedIn Outreach

Engaged event coordinators with content around event production quality and brand storytelling, building awareness of Manifaith's capabilities before the direct ask.

### AI Cold Calling

Targeted corporate experience teams at companies planning major events, where a brief conversation about production scope and timeline accelerated booking faster than email alone.

### Beyond the Meetings

- **Market Intelligence:** Event calendar targeting revealed corporate experience coordinators planning events 60-90 days out had the highest conversion, establishing the optimal outreach timing window.
- **Pipeline Insurance:** Multi-channel coverage ensured that when planners were too busy to check email during event week, LinkedIn and calling maintained contact.
- **ICP Refinement:** Event planners responded at higher rates than CMOs, validating the strategy of targeting people who actually hire production teams rather than budget approvers.
- **Proof-First Positioning:** Mini-case-study sequences eliminated lengthy sales presentations, with prospects arriving pre-sold on capabilities and ready to discuss scope.

# Zycada — 1,381% ROI

Zycada spent \$5,400 over 3 months and generated \$80,000 in revenue — a 1,381% ROI — after previous lead generation firms delivered zero results. 32 meetings and 5 new customers earned through platform-specific BigCommerce merchant targeting with a 33% reply rate. The first firm to actually deliver.

  **\$80,000 in revenue. 5 new customers. 33% reply rate.** Previous firms delivered zero. Platform-specific targeting was the breakthrough.

## The Challenge

Every online retailer knows speed matters, but most don't act until they see exactly how much revenue they're losing. Generic "make your site faster" pitches get ignored. Zycada needed platform-specific messaging showing conversion rate improvements for BigCommerce merchants specifically.

Other lead generation firms had already failed — zero results, wasted budget. Generic e-commerce performance messaging without platform-specific targeting or conversion data fell flat.

**Before Outbound System:**

- Previous lead gen firms delivered zero results
- Generic "faster site" messaging ignored by merchants
- No platform-specific targeting strategy
- No conversion rate data tied to specific e-commerce platforms

**After Outbound System:**

- 5 new customers converted in 3 months
- 33% reply rate from e-commerce decision-makers
- Platform-specific BigCommerce targeting driving results
- First firm to deliver results after multiple failed attempts

## The Solution

Prospect lists targeted a specific platform signal: BigCommerce merchants. BigCommerce stores face performance challenges at scale that Zycada's technology directly addresses.

### Cold Email

Sequences led with platform-specific performance data: how comparable BigCommerce stores improved conversion rates and reduced cart abandonment after implementing Zycada. Enterprise infrastructure maintained deliverability.

### LinkedIn Outreach

Targeted e-commerce leaders with content about site speed's measurable revenue impact, building awareness before the email pitch.

### AI Cold Calling

Deployed for enterprise BigCommerce merchants where contract value warranted a direct conversation about platform performance.

### Beyond the Meetings

- **Market Intelligence:** Targeting revealed which store sizes and verticals had the most acute performance pain.
- **ICP Refinement:** Merchants in the $5M-$20M revenue range showed highest conversion — traffic volume made performance optimization directly measurable.
- **Platform Validation:** The 33% reply rate validated that platform-specific targeting dramatically outperforms broad e-commerce prospecting.

  <Accordion title="Why did platform-specific targeting work when broader approaches failed?">
    BigCommerce merchants have specific performance challenges that generic e-commerce messaging doesn't address. When outreach references the prospect's exact platform and shows conversion improvements from comparable stores, it demonstrates understanding that generic pitches never achieve. The 33% reply rate validated this approach.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happened with Zycada's previous lead gen firms?">
    They delivered zero results. Platform-specific targeting combined with enterprise deliverability infrastructure was the combination that broke through where generic approaches failed.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What size merchants responded best?">
    BigCommerce merchants in the $5M-$20M revenue range showed the highest conversion rates. At this scale, traffic volume makes site performance directly measurable in revenue impact.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How is the $80,000 revenue figure verified?">
    Revenue reflects cash collected from the 5 new customers acquired through the campaign, not contract value or projected lifetime value. $80,000 from $5,400 spend equals a 14.81x ROAS.

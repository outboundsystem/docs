# INTUIFY — 733% ROI

INTUIFY spent \$5,400 over 3 months and generated \$45,000 in revenue — a 733% ROI — by getting category-personalized research methodology in front of CPG brand managers at exactly the right moment: when product launches were active and research budgets were live. 15 meetings including major brands like Pepsi, with 64 qualified responses per month. Results strong enough that INTUIFY came back for a second engagement.

  **\$45,000 in revenue. 64 responses/month. Including Pepsi.** INTUIFY returned for a second engagement — the strongest validation of pipeline quality.

## The Challenge

CPG brand managers are drowning in sanitized survey data that tells them what they already know. INTUIFY's unfiltered consumer insights methodology delivers what they actually need, but another research vendor pitch gets deleted instantly.

Brand managers needed to see how INTUIFY's innovative methodology produces insights that change decisions, not just confirm existing assumptions. Generic market research outreach without category-specific personalization failed to differentiate from traditional survey-based vendors.

**Before Outbound System:**

- Generic research vendor pitches getting deleted
- No category-specific personalization for CPG brands
- No proof of methodology producing decision-changing insights
- No targeting based on active product launch or innovation signals

**After Outbound System:**

- 15 meetings booked including major brands
- 64 qualified responses per month on average
- Category-specific messaging resonating with brand managers
- Client returned for second engagement after first delivered

## The Solution

Prospect lists targeted brand managers, consumer insights directors, and innovation leads at CPG companies actively launching new products or entering new categories. These signals meant research budgets were live and decisions were being made.

### Cold Email

Personalized by product category: beverage brand managers heard beverage research proof, personal care managers heard personal care insights. Enterprise infrastructure penetrated Fortune 500 corporate email filtering.

### LinkedIn Outreach

Content-driven engagement sharing consumer insight trends, demonstrating INTUIFY's expertise before asking for a meeting.

### AI Cold Calling

Deployed selectively for the largest CPG brands where a brief conversation about research methodology could quickly differentiate INTUIFY from traditional survey vendors.

### Beyond the Meetings

- **Market Intelligence:** Brands in active product launches responded at 3x the rate of brands in maintenance mode, confirming timing around innovation cycles is critical.
- **ICP Refinement:** Consumer insights directors showed higher engagement than brand managers, suggesting the research-specific buyer is a stronger entry point.
- **Repeat Engagement:** INTUIFY returned for a second engagement — the strongest possible validation of pipeline quality and consistency.

  <Accordion title="How did INTUIFY reach Fortune 500 CPG brand managers?">
    Enterprise Azure infrastructure with dedicated U.S. IPs and Outlook inboxes penetrated Fortune 500 corporate email filtering. Category-personalized messaging (beverage-specific proof for beverage brands) earned attention from brand managers who delete generic research vendor pitches.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why did INTUIFY return for a second engagement?">
    The first campaign delivered 15 meetings including major brand engagement, 64 monthly responses, and $45,000 in revenue from a $5,400 spend. Results validated the approach strongly enough that INTUIFY re-engaged for continued pipeline generation.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What targeting signals identified the right CPG companies?">
    Active product launches and new category entries. These signals meant research budgets were live and decisions were being made. Brands in maintenance mode responded at one-third the rate of brands in active innovation cycles.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why was cost per meeting higher at $360?">
    Enterprise CPG meetings command higher costs because the audience is smaller (fewer Fortune 500 brand managers than SMB owners) and harder to reach (aggressive corporate email filtering). The \$360 cost is justified by average deal values that far exceed the cost per meeting.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How is the $45,000 revenue calculated?">
    Cash collected from deals closed through the 3-month campaign. $45,000 from $5,400 spend equals an 8.33x return, or 733% ROI. Revenue reflects actual money received, not contract value.

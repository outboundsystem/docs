# Portiva — 9.4x ROI

Portiva turned 1,000+ implementations into a consistent outbound pipeline: 56 meetings booked over 9 months with 31 qualified responses per month. The ROI math did the selling — $35K-$45K for in-house admin staff vs. $10/hour through Portiva. When practice managers saw the cost comparison paired with 1,000+ implementation proof, the trust barrier dissolved and conversations turned into contracts.

## The Challenge

Healthcare practices are drowning in admin work, but convincing them to trust a virtual assistant with patient-facing tasks requires proof at scale. Portiva had 1,000+ implementations but needed systematic outreach to surface that proof to the right buyers at the right time.

The staffing pain was real but the trust barrier was high. Practice managers needed massive social proof and clear ROI math before considering virtual assistants for patient-facing work. Limited outbound wasn't surfacing the ROI math or social proof from 1,000+ implementations effectively, and there was no targeting based on active hiring intent.

**Before Outbound System:**
- No systematic outbound despite 1,000+ implementations
- Trust barrier for virtual assistants in healthcare
- ROI math not surfaced early in conversations
- No targeting of practices actively hiring admin roles

**After Outbound System:**
- 56 meetings booked over 9 months
- 31 qualified responses per month on average
- Steady, predictable pipeline matching onboarding capacity
- Cost-comparison messaging driving qualified conversations

## The Solution

Built around making the 1,000+ implementation number impossible to ignore. Targeting focused on practice managers actively hiring for admin roles — a signal they were feeling staffing pain right now, not hypothetically. Messaging led with cost comparison: $35K-$45K for in-house vs. $10/hour through Portiva.

### Cold Email

Sequences surfacing ROI math early and following with social proof from comparable practice types. The cost-comparison framework drove the narrative — not capability descriptions, but specific savings calculations.

### LinkedIn Outreach

Engaged practice owners with content around healthcare staffing challenges and operational efficiency, building credibility in the healthcare staffing space before the meeting ask.

### AI Cold Calling

Targeted multi-location practices where staffing cost savings at scale justified a direct conversation. A 60-second call about admin staffing costs converted phone-first healthcare buyers.

### Beyond the Meetings

- **Market Intelligence:** Targeting practices with active admin job postings proved the strongest intent signal, converting at 3x the rate of demographic-only targeting.
- **Pipeline Insurance:** Three-channel coverage kept outreach consistent across 9 months, with no single-channel failures disrupting the steady 31 responses/month pipeline.
- **ICP Refinement:** Multi-location practices showed highest engagement because cost savings multiplied across locations, making the ROI case even more compelling per practice.
- **Capacity-Matched Pipeline:** 31 responses per month created pipeline matching Portiva's onboarding capacity, avoiding feast-or-famine cycles that strain operations.

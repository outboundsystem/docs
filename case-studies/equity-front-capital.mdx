## The Challenge

Agency owners who might be open to investment or acquisition get pitched constantly and delete anything that smells like a template. Earning their attention requires demonstrated homework — not personalization tokens, but genuine knowledge of their business trajectory and milestones.

Template-based M&A outreach that failed to demonstrate prospect-specific research or acknowledge individual business milestones was producing limited pipeline of qualified acquisition targets.

**Before Outbound System:**
- Template outreach deleted by pitch-resistant agency owners
- No milestone-anchored personalization in messaging
- Limited pipeline of qualified acquisition targets
- No multi-channel strategy for long-term relationship building

**After Outbound System:**
- 122 qualified meetings in 10 months
- 21% sustained reply rate across the entire campaign
- Milestone-anchored outreach earning conversations consistently
- Compounding relationship pipeline as owners approach exit windows

## The Solution

Multi-provider verification built a high-fidelity picture of each prospect: revenue signals, team size, growth trajectory, and recent milestones. Outreach was anchored to specific milestones (awards, client wins, team expansions), demonstrating genuine research rather than template insertion.

### Cold Email

Crafted around funding milestones and successful exits in the agency space, positioning Equity Front as a partner who understands the specific dynamics of scaling and exiting a services business. Each sequence referenced the prospect's specific growth trajectory.

### LinkedIn Outreach

Targeted agency founders with engagement around growth strategy and M&A content, creating multiple touchpoints that built familiarity over time as owners progressed toward exit readiness.

### AI Cold Calling

Deployed for agency owners showing strong engagement signals but who hadn't booked. Brief, peer-level conversations about growth plans and exit timelines converted interest into meetings.

### Beyond the Meetings

- **Market Intelligence:** Multi-provider verification revealed revenue and growth trajectory signals that identified which agency owners were most likely approaching their exit window, enabling prioritized outreach.
- **Pipeline Insurance:** Three-channel coverage over 10 months ensured agency owners who ignored initial outreach were re-engaged through different channels as exit timelines progressed.
- **ICP Refinement:** Agencies with 15-40 employees and recent hiring milestones showed the highest engagement rates, indicating the sweet spot between growth ambition and exit readiness.
- **Compounding Relationships:** 122 qualified conversations created a pipeline that compounds over time as agency owners who said "not yet" move closer to their exit window.

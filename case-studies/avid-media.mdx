# AVID Media — 58.9x ROI

AVID Media went from broken deliverability across 35 markets to 862K+ in qualified pipeline in 8 months. The fix wasn't messaging or lists — it was the infrastructure underneath everything. Enterprise Azure hosting, MX-based routing, and market-segmented sequences turned zero predictable pipeline into 95 qualified meetings at 152 each.

| Industry      | Advertising                   |
| Company Size  | 35+ markets, 50-200 employees |

## The Challenge

Emails were not landing in primary inboxes across any of AVID Media's 35 markets. Pipeline was leaking at every stage because prospects never saw the outreach. No amount of list-building or copywriting mattered when messages hit spam or promotions tabs instead of primary inboxes.

Internal list-building efforts, generic email campaigns lacking local relevance, and standard infrastructure that couldn't maintain inbox placement across multiple markets had produced zero predictable outbound pipeline.

**Before Outbound System:**

- Zero predictable outbound pipeline across 35 markets
- Emails landing in spam and promotions tabs, not primary inboxes
- No market-specific messaging or local relevance
- Zero competitive intelligence on local advertising landscape

**After Outbound System:**

- 95 qualified meetings booked in 8 months
- \$862K+ in qualified pipeline built and converting
- Consistent primary inbox placement across all 35 markets
- Market-by-market outreach with local performance data

## The Solution

The foundation had to be rebuilt before any outreach could work. Enterprise infrastructure — 2 USA IPs, 100 Outlook inboxes, private Azure hosting — with MX-based routing restored inbox placement across all 35 markets. Outreach was then segmented by market and vertical so every prospect received messaging referencing local advertising results.

### Cold Email

Market-segmented sequences leading with AVID Media's specific performance metrics from comparable local businesses across all 35 markets. Each vertical received tailored proof points matching their advertising challenges.

### LinkedIn Outreach

Reinforced email campaigns by engaging prospects in each market with localized content and direct outreach, creating multi-channel familiarity before the first sales conversation.

### Beyond the Meetings

- **Market Intelligence:** Campaign data revealed which of the 35 markets had the highest response rates and shortest sales cycles, allowing AVID Media to prioritize expansion efforts based on actual demand signals.
- **Pipeline Insurance:** Multi-channel coverage across email and LinkedIn meant that when email engagement dipped in specific markets, LinkedIn kept conversations alive and meetings flowing.
- **ICP Refinement:** Response data showed that local business owners with under \$500K in annual revenue converted at 2.4x the rate of larger accounts, reshaping targeting priorities across all markets.
- **Compounding Pipeline:** Leads continued converting months after initial contact. The warm database of earlier prospects became a reliable secondary pipeline source.

> "Before Outbound System, our deliverability was broken. We weren't landing in inboxes and were losing pipeline across all 35 markets we operate in. Within two weeks of onboarding, we were seeing significantly better results. Since joining, we've generated over 95 leads and built a pipeline that keeps converting months down the road."

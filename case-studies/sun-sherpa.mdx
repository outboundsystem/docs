# Sun Sherpa — 7.3x ROI

Sun Sherpa booked 25 meetings in 5 months with 72 qualified responses per month by leading with supply chain reliability instead of marketing language. Solar installers don't care about "premium solutions." They care about panels arriving on schedule for next week's install. Deliberately operational messaging — on-time delivery rates, inventory depth, and warranty terms — earned conversations aspirational positioning never could.

## The Challenge

Solar installation companies buy equipment based on three things: reliability, pricing, and supply chain consistency. Marketing fluff doesn't work with these operational buyers. Installers need proof of on-time delivery rates, inventory depth, and warranty terms — not "premium solar solutions."

Aspirational messaging that didn't address the operational supply chain concerns solar installers actually prioritize when evaluating suppliers was producing limited pipeline.

**Before Outbound System:**
- Aspirational messaging failing with operational buyers
- No supply-chain-focused proof in outreach
- No targeting based on installer growth signals
- Limited pipeline with growing installation companies

**After Outbound System:**
- 25 meetings booked in 5 months
- 72 qualified responses per month on average
- Operational supply chain messaging resonating with installers
- Growing installers connecting for long-term supply partnerships

## The Solution

Company lookalike targeting combined with Findymail verification focused on growing solar installation companies adding crews, expanding territories, or bidding on larger commercial projects. These signals indicated companies scaling past their current supplier's capacity — the exact moment when supply partnerships get evaluated.

### Cold Email

Sequences led with supply chain reliability: on-time delivery rates, inventory depth, and equipment warranty terms from comparable installers. Deliberately operational, not aspirational. Each email addressed the question installers actually ask: "will this arrive on time for my next job?"

### LinkedIn Outreach

Targeted installation company owners active in solar industry groups, engaging with their content and positioning Sun Sherpa as a supply partner rather than another equipment vendor.

### AI Cold Calling

90-second conversations about equipment availability and pricing for the prospect's next project. Turning supply questions into booked meetings by addressing immediate operational needs.

### Beyond the Meetings

- **Market Intelligence:** Growth signal targeting (adding crews, expanding territories) identified installers scaling past current supplier capacity — the exact moment when supply partnerships are evaluated.
- **Pipeline Insurance:** Three-channel coverage ensured that even installers on job sites all day still received outreach through the channel they checked most frequently.
- **ICP Refinement:** Installers bidding on commercial (vs. residential) projects showed the highest response rates, as commercial volumes justify formal supply partnership evaluation.
- **Operational Credibility:** Leading with supply chain metrics rather than product features immediately positioned Sun Sherpa as an operations-focused partner.

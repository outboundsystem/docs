## The Challenge

DTC brands evaluate advertising agencies on one metric: can you acquire customers profitably at scale? Convert had the proof but needed precision targeting to get it in front of the right founders.

DTC founders are ROI-obsessed and category-specific. Generic advertising claims fail. Every prospect needed to see proof from their exact product category to take the meeting.

**Before Outbound System:**

- Generic advertising claims failing with ROI-obsessed DTC founders
- No category-matched case studies in outreach
- No systematic targeting based on growth signals
- Broad DTC outreach without vertical specificity

**After Outbound System:**

- 5-7 qualified leads per week consistently
- 70% closing rate on generated leads
- Category-matched proof driving unprecedented conversion
- $64 cost per booked meeting across the campaign

## The Solution

Six-source verified prospect lists targeted scaling DTC brands by ad spend growth, new product launches, and marketing hiring. Every sequence included a category-matched case study.

### Cold Email

Primary volume channel through enterprise infrastructure. Built entirely around specific ROI metrics: CAC, ROAS benchmarks, and revenue growth from the prospect's exact product category.

### LinkedIn Outreach

Engaged DTC founders with content about paid acquisition strategies, building category expertise credibility before the direct ask.

### AI Cold Calling

Supplemented email for high-value prospects, using brief scripts leading with the most relevant performance metric for the prospect's product category.

### Beyond the Meetings

- **Market Intelligence:** Category-matching revealed supplements and skincare had the highest close rates, providing a prioritized expansion roadmap.
- **ICP Refinement:** DTC brands in the $1M-$10M revenue range with increasing ad spend showed the highest conversion.
- **Extraordinary Close Rate:** 70% validated that category-matched proof is the single most powerful driver of agency sales in DTC.

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="How did Convert achieve a 70% close rate on cold outbound leads?">
    Category-matched case studies. Every DTC founder received proof from their exact product category — skincare brands saw skincare ROAS data, supplements brands saw supplements acquisition metrics. Prospects arrived pre-sold on the value before the first call.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What made $64 per meeting possible?">
    Precise targeting (DTC brands with active ad spend growth), category-matched messaging (higher reply rates reduce cost per response), and enterprise infrastructure (99% inbox placement means no wasted sends). When all three align, cost per meeting drops dramatically.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What DTC categories responded best?">
    Supplements and skincare led in close rates. The key wasn't the category — it was the precision of matching. A food brand seeing food-specific ROAS data responded just as strongly as skincare seeing skincare data.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How sustainable were the 5-7 leads per week?">
    Sustained across the full 3-month campaign, producing 84 total meetings. Consistency came from continuous list refreshment through growth signal monitoring and A/B testing of messaging variants within each category.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How is the 5,733% ROI calculated?">
    $315,000 in cash collected divided by $5,400 total spend equals 58.33x return, or 5,733% ROI. Third-highest across all 44 case studies, driven by the extraordinary 70% close rate.

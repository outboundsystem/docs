## The Challenge

Selling marketing services to SaaS companies is a timing game. Too early and there's no budget. Too late and they've already hired an agency. SaaS companies had to be reached within a narrow post-funding window when CAC optimization moves from aspirational to urgent.

Broad SaaS targeting without funding-stage filtering or timing-specific outreach was missing the decision window entirely while generic marketing services positioning failed to differentiate by stage.

**Before Outbound System:**
- No funding-trigger-based outreach timing
- Broad SaaS targeting missing the decision window
- Generic marketing services positioning
- No stage-specific messaging (Series A vs. Series B+)

**After Outbound System:**
- 35 qualified meetings in 90 days
- 31% reply rate sustained across channels
- 3 deals closed with funded SaaS companies
- Funding-stage-specific messaging driving conversions

## The Solution

Outbound was built around one trigger: recent funding announcements. Companies within 60-90 days of closing a round were identified using funding databases and LinkedIn activity monitoring. Messaging was tailored by funding stage — Series A companies heard about building scalable acquisition channels from scratch, Series B+ heard about reducing bloated CAC from underperforming agency relationships.

### Cold Email

All sequences led with specific CAC benchmarks from comparable clients. Series A messaging focused on building from zero. Series B+ messaging focused on fixing underperformance. The stage-specific framing made every email relevant to the prospect's exact situation.

### LinkedIn Outreach

Targeted marketing and growth leads at the same funded accounts, creating multi-channel visibility that made Alo feel like a name prospects kept seeing for a reason rather than a one-off cold pitch.

### AI Cold Calling

Targeted the highest-value funded companies with brief scripts focused on CAC reduction metrics relevant to the prospect's stage and vertical. Founders overwhelmed by post-funding activity responded to direct phone conversations when email fell through.

### Beyond the Meetings

- **Market Intelligence:** Funding database monitoring created a real-time view of which SaaS verticals attracted the most investment, informing Alo Media's go-to-market expansion strategy.
- **Pipeline Insurance:** Multi-channel coverage meant founders overwhelmed by post-funding activity still encountered Alo through LinkedIn and calling when email fell through.
- **ICP Refinement:** Series A companies responded at higher rates to "build from scratch" messaging, while Series B+ responded to "fix underperformance," validating stage-specific approach.
- **Timing Precision:** The 60-90 day post-funding window proved optimal, with response rates dropping 40% for companies contacted outside this window.

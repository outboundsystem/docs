## What These Case Studies Have in Common

Every campaign above follows the same infrastructure-first methodology: enterprise-grade deliverability (private Azure hosting, dedicated U.S. IPs, 100+ Outlook inboxes), six-source verified prospect lists, and messaging built around the prospect's specific business context rather than generic service descriptions.

The variation is in the results — and the variation tracks to three factors: deal size, sales cycle length, and how well the client's team converts meetings to revenue. A 70% close rate (Convert) produces a 57.3x return on the same infrastructure that produces 3.2x when the close rate is lower (App Labs). The meetings and lead quality are consistent. The downstream conversion is what separates a good campaign from a historic one.

<Tip>

The median cost per booked meeting across all 44 campaigns is $200. The median ROI is 10.7x. These numbers include every client — not just the top performers.

</Tip>

## How to Read These Case Studies

Each case study follows a consistent structure so you can compare apples to apples across all engagements:

<Steps>

  <Step title="Hero Metrics">

    Total spend, revenue generated, ROI multiple, meetings booked, and cost per meeting — all calculated on cash collected, not contract value or projected pipeline.

  </Step>

  <Step title="The Challenge">

    What the client was dealing with before Outbound System, including specific before/after comparisons and the approaches that had already failed.

  </Step>

  <Step title="The Solution">

    Channel-by-channel breakdown of what was deployed (cold email, LinkedIn, AI calling), the specific messaging strategy, and the "beyond the meetings" insights the campaign uncovered.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Full Metrics Table">

    Complete input and output metrics including qualified leads generated, cost per lead, show-up rate, new MRR added, and ROAS on cash collected.

Every case study above started with a single conversation about the client's ICP, deal size, and pipeline goals. If you sell B2B and your average deal is worth $5K+, the math on outsourced outbound works.

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="How is ROI calculated in these case studies?">
    ROI is expressed as a return multiple on cash collected, not contract value or projected pipeline. The formula: Revenue Generated / Total Spend. If a client spent $5,400 and collected $90,000 in actual revenue from deals closed through the campaign, that's a 15.7x return. Revenue figures are reported directly by clients and reflect money that hit their bank account.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the average cost per meeting across all 44 clients?">
    The median cost per booked meeting across all 44 campaigns is $200. The range spans from $64 (Convert, DTC advertising) to $720 (Telescope, enterprise CPG). Cost per meeting correlates with target market sophistication — enterprise SaaS and Fortune 500 CPG meetings cost more to generate than SMB service business meetings. In all cases, the cost per meeting is a fraction of the revenue each meeting produces.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do these results include every client, or just the best ones?">
    Every client engagement is included. The lowest ROI in the portfolio is 3.2x (App Labs), and even that engagement produced a positive return within 60 days. There is no selection bias — these 44 case studies represent the full body of documented client results, ranging from 3.2x to 58.9x ROI.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How long does it typically take to see results?">
    Most campaigns generate first qualified responses within 5-11 days of launch. First meetings typically book within the first 2-3 weeks. Full campaign momentum — where compounding pipeline and optimized messaging produce peak results — generally takes 60-90 days. Some campaigns (FireVibe, Manifaith, Ocean, 3rd Degree Screening, Employee Cycle) produced significant revenue within 30 days.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What industries have the strongest results?">
    The highest ROI campaigns span multiple industries: advertising (AVID Media, 58.9x), DTC e-commerce (Convert, 57.3x), video production (Manifaith, 50.7x), and manufacturing (PlantSwitch, 29.6x). Agencies and professional services represent the largest category with 14 case studies, but enterprise SaaS (Automation Anywhere, 23.3x) and financial services (Equity Front Capital, 19.3x) also produce consistently strong results. The common factor isn't industry — it's deal size and sales team conversion ability.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if my industry isn't represented here?">
    These 44 case studies span SaaS, agencies, financial services, healthcare, manufacturing, energy, real estate, HR services, events, construction, market research, and blockchain. The underlying methodology — infrastructure-first deliverability, six-source verified lists, and context-specific messaging — applies to any B2B company where the average deal value justifies outbound investment (generally $5K+). If your industry isn't listed, the [strategy call](https://outboundsystem.com/book) covers whether outbound fits your specific market dynamics.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I see the full metrics for a specific case study?">
    Every individual case study page includes the complete metrics table: total spend, campaign duration, qualified leads generated, cost per lead, meetings booked, cost per meeting, show-up rate, revenue generated, new MRR added, ROAS, and total ROI.

# Evolved Commerce — 9x ROI

Evolved Commerce booked 33 meetings and closed 3 deals in 3 months by speaking Amazon's native language. Prospects consistently noted the outreach "actually understood Amazon" — a differentiator no generic agency pitch can replicate. Messaging led with ACOS improvement, organic ranking gains, buy box win rates, and review velocity, the metrics Amazon sellers evaluate against their own dashboards daily.

## The Challenge

Amazon sellers operate in a data-rich environment and are naturally skeptical of marketing pitches that don't speak their language. They measure success in ACOS, organic rankings, buy box win rates, and review velocity. If outreach doesn't reference those metrics, it gets deleted alongside every other "we'll grow your business" email.

Standard digital marketing outreach that didn't speak Amazon's native language or reference marketplace-specific metrics was producing no systematic pipeline.

**Before Outbound System:**
- Generic marketing outreach failing with Amazon sellers
- No marketplace-native metrics in messaging
- No systematic targeting of $1M+ Amazon brands
- Single-channel approach missing different seller workflows

**After Outbound System:**
- 33 meetings booked in 3 months
- 3 deals closed with Amazon sellers
- Marketplace-fluent outreach earning conversations
- Multi-channel catching sellers at different workflow points

## The Solution

Prospect lists targeted Amazon sellers at scale ($1M+ marketplace revenue) using marketplace data and LinkedIn verification. Enterprise infrastructure (2 USA IPs, 100 Outlook inboxes) ensured deliverability. Every sequence led with Amazon-native metrics.

### Cold Email

Led with ACOS improvement, organic ranking gains, buy box win rates, and review velocity. Not generic "digital marketing" but Amazon-specific proof that sellers could evaluate against their own dashboards immediately.

### LinkedIn Outreach

Engaged Amazon sellers with content about marketplace growth strategies, building Evolved Commerce's e-commerce credibility before the direct ask.

### AI Cold Calling

Follow-up channel for prospects who opened emails but didn't respond. Metric-driven scripts caught sellers who make fast decisions between inventory checks.

### Beyond the Meetings

- **Market Intelligence:** Outreach data revealed Amazon sellers cared most about ACOS reduction messaging, providing positioning data applicable to broader marketing strategy.
- **Pipeline Insurance:** Multi-channel caught sellers at different workflow points: email for methodical planners, phone for fast decision-makers between inventory checks.
- **ICP Refinement:** Sellers doing $1M-$5M annually showed highest engagement — volume to invest but often lacking sophisticated marketplace marketing support.
- **Marketplace Fluency Validation:** Prospects consistently noted the outreach "actually understood Amazon," confirming native-language messaging as the key differentiator.

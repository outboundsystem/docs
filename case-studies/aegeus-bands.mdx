# Aegeus Bands — 8.1x ROI

Aegeus Bands broke into the event industry's relationship-driven buying cycle with 29 qualified meetings and 7 closed deals in 6 months. The unlock was segmentation by event type: festival ops directors care about speed and durability, corporate planners care about branding and customization. One-size-fits-all messaging fails in events, but segment-specific outreach earns conversations.

## The Challenge

The event industry buys on relationships and referrals, making cold outreach harder — but also meaning there's less competition in the inbox for those who do it right. Reaching real decision-makers (event directors, operations leads, brand experience managers) instead of generic info@ addresses was the core bottleneck.

Broad event industry outreach without segmentation by event type and generic credential pitches that didn't address segment-specific priorities had produced no systematic pipeline.

**Before Outbound System:**
- No systematic outbound to event decision-makers
- Generic credential pitches across all event types
- Reliant on industry relationships and referrals
- No segmented approach by event category

**After Outbound System:**
- 29 qualified meetings booked in 6 months
- 7 high-value deals closed with event buyers
- Segmented outreach across 4 event categories
- Six-source verified decision-maker targeting

## The Solution

Lists were built using six-source verification to reach actual decision-makers, then segmented by event type: music festivals, corporate conferences, sporting events, and brand activations. Each segment received messaging addressing their specific credential priorities.

### Cold Email

Primary channel with messaging tracks for each event segment. Azure U.S. IP infrastructure ensured inbox placement past promotions tabs where event vendor outreach typically dies.

### LinkedIn Outreach

Engaged event planners with content around event operations and attendee experience, building credibility before the direct ask.

### AI Cold Calling

Targeted high-value accounts planning large-scale events, where a brief conversation about credential needs and timelines accelerated the sales cycle beyond what email alone could achieve.

### Beyond the Meetings

- **Market Intelligence:** Response data revealed brand activation planners had the highest close rate while music festival ops had the fastest response time, enabling differentiated follow-up strategies.
- **Pipeline Insurance:** Event buying is seasonal. Multi-channel coverage meant when email dipped during peak event season, LinkedIn and calling kept conversations alive.
- **ICP Refinement:** Six-source verification eliminated the info@ problem entirely. Decision-maker accuracy improved targeting ROI across all segments.
- **Warm Database:** Event planners who said "not now" were logged for re-engagement when their next event cycle began, aligned with industry seasonality.

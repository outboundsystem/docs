## The Challenge

The campaign needed to outperform Velox Media's experienced internal sales team — not just replicate their existing efforts. Velox had a strong internal team that knew their retail market. Outbound needed to bring volume and targeting precision they couldn't match internally.

Internal sales team efforts over 4 years couldn't match the volume and precision needed to scale pipeline generation in the retail brand market. No previous agency had outperformed the internal team.

**Before Outbound System:**
- Internal team couldn't match needed outbound volume
- 4 years without any agency outpacing internal lead generation
- No systematic growth-signal-based retail brand targeting
- Pipeline growth constrained by internal team capacity

**After Outbound System:**
- 60 meetings in 6 months
- 72 qualified responses per month on average
- First agency in 4 years to outperform the internal team
- Growth-signal targeting identifying scaling retail brands

## The Solution

Prospect lists used revenue growth signals, hiring patterns, and digital ad spend indicators to identify retail brands in active scaling phases. Not any retailer — ones whose growth trajectory meant they'd outgrow current marketing within 6-12 months. This predictive targeting produced higher-quality conversations than the internal team's existing network.

### Cold Email

Primary volume driver with sequences citing percentage improvements in ROAS and revenue for named verticals. Specific growth metrics from comparable retail clients, not generic claims.

### LinkedIn Outreach

Provided air cover on the same accounts, with Velox's team engaging prospects' content to create organic familiarity before the direct pitch arrived.

### AI Cold Calling

Targeted retail brands at the highest growth rates with brief scripts focused on the specific ROI metrics most relevant to the prospect's retail vertical.

### Beyond the Meetings

- **Market Intelligence:** Growth signal analysis identified which retail verticals were scaling fastest, giving Velox a data-backed view of where their services would be most in demand over the next 6-12 months.
- **Pipeline Insurance:** Three-channel coverage at 72 responses/month meant no seasonal dip or channel issue could significantly impact pipeline flow.
- **ICP Refinement:** Retail brands in the $5M-$25M revenue range with 20%+ year-over-year growth showed the highest conversion rates, sharpening Velox's ideal client profile.
- **Internal Benchmark:** The campaign established a new volume and quality benchmark that the internal team hadn't achieved in four years, validating outsourced outbound as a force multiplier.

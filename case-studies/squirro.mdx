# Squirro — 10.1x ROI

Squirro booked 28 meetings with CTO-level buyers in 7 months by replacing feature lists with a concrete performance claim: "3x faster insights for enterprises with comparable data environments." Tech-stack targeting identified companies with the right data infrastructure, and 43 qualified responses per month meant prospects arrived to calls already understanding Squirro's technical positioning — dramatically reducing initial education time.

## The Challenge

Selling enterprise AI to CTOs requires a fundamentally different outbound approach. These buyers evaluate through a technical lens and want architecture details, integration feasibility, and performance benchmarks — not feature lists and buzzwords. Standard outreach gets dismissed on sight by technically sophisticated CTO and VP Engineering audiences.

Feature-list and buzzword-heavy outreach was failing to earn attention from the exact buyers Squirro needed to reach at enterprise companies.

**Before Outbound System:**

- Feature-list outreach failing with technical buyers
- No tech-stack-based targeting for high-fit accounts
- CTOs dismissing generic AI vendor pitches
- No channel for converting content-engaged prospects to meetings

**After Outbound System:**

- 28 meetings in 7 months with CTO-level buyers
- 43 qualified responses per month on average
- Tech-stack targeting identifying high-fit enterprise accounts
- Prospects arriving with clear understanding of technical positioning

## The Solution

Prospect lists used tech stack data and organizational signals: companies with large unstructured datasets, data science teams of a certain size, and specific technology environments Squirro integrates with. Messaging led with "3x faster insights for enterprises with comparable data environments" — specific enough to be credible, technical enough to earn a CTO's attention.

### Cold Email

Sequences with a concrete performance claim backed by enough technical specificity to earn CTO attention without overwhelming the email format. Enterprise infrastructure ensuring delivery past aggressive corporate filters.

### LinkedIn Outreach

Targeted CTOs and VP Engineering with messaging focused on technical differentiation between Squirro's generative AI search and retrieval approaches prospects were already using.

### AI Cold Calling

Strategic third channel for accounts that engaged with content but hadn't booked. Brief, technically informed calls reframing conversations around specific data challenges converted interest into meetings.

### Beyond the Meetings

- **Market Intelligence:** Tech stack targeting revealed which technology environments had the highest conversion rates, creating a data-driven expansion roadmap for Squirro's sales team.
- **Pipeline Insurance:** AI calling converted content-engaged-but-not-booked prospects, capturing value from technical buyers who prefer verbal discussion over email response.
- **ICP Refinement:** Companies with 10+ person data science teams showed the highest response rates, indicating the maturity threshold needed to evaluate and implement Squirro effectively.
- **Pre-Qualified Conversations:** Sales team reported prospects arrived with clear understanding of technical positioning, dramatically reducing initial education time in first calls.

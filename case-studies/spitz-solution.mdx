## The Challenge

Coaches and consultants buy PR for one reason: credibility that converts to clients. They don't care about impressions or media mentions as vanity metrics. They want visibility that drives inbound leads and premium pricing.

The typical PR pitch of "we'll get you media coverage" doesn't resonate. Coaches need to see how PR directly correlates with revenue growth and premium pricing, not just press mentions. Standard PR outreach promising coverage without connecting it to revenue outcomes was falling flat.

**Before Outbound System:**

- Standard "media coverage" PR pitches underperforming
- No ROI framework connecting PR to revenue growth
- No targeting based on personal brand investment signals
- Coaches dismissing PR as a vanity metric expense

**After Outbound System:**

- 10 clients closed in 4 months
- 34% reply rate from coaches and consultants
- ROI-framed PR messaging driving conversions
- Leads arriving already understanding the PR investment model

## The Solution

Prospect lists identified coaches and consultants actively investing in their personal brand — publishing content, speaking, running paid ads — but lacking the media credibility layer that separates a $5K coach from a $25K coach. Multi-provider verification ensured reach to actual business owners, not assistants.

### Cold Email

Led with specific PR wins from comparable clients: podcast placements, publication features, and speaking invitations that directly correlated with revenue growth. Framed as ROI, not vanity.

### LinkedIn Outreach

Ideal secondary channel. Coaches live on LinkedIn. Engaging with their content before direct conversation created a warmer entry point than cold email alone.

### Beyond the Meetings

- **Market Intelligence:** Personal brand investment signals (content publishing, speaking, paid ads) proved reliable indicators of PR readiness, creating a scalable targeting framework.
- **Pipeline Insurance:** LinkedIn and email in parallel ensured coaches who filter vendor emails still encountered Spitz through organic content engagement on their primary platform.
- **ICP Refinement:** Coaches generating $100K-$500K annually showed the highest conversion — the sweet spot where PR investment is affordable and the credibility gap is most acutely felt.

<Tip>
  Leading with "here's what happened to a similar coach's inbound pipeline after three months of strategic PR" reframes PR from a vanity expense to a revenue investment. This single messaging shift drove the 34% reply rate.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How did ROI-framed messaging outperform traditional PR pitches?">
    Traditional PR pitches lead with outputs: "we'll get you featured in Forbes." ROI-framed messaging leads with outcomes: "here's what happened to a similar coach's inbound pipeline and pricing power after three months of strategic PR." Coaches don't buy press mentions — they buy the revenue impact of credibility. Framing PR as a revenue investment earned a 34% reply rate where coverage-first messaging was getting deleted.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What personal brand signals indicated PR readiness?">
    Three signals: active content publishing (blog posts, social content), speaking engagement activity (conferences, podcasts), and paid advertising spend. These signals indicate a coach already investing in visibility who needs the media credibility layer to command premium pricing. Coaches without these signals typically aren't ready to invest in PR.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What coaching revenue level converted best?">
    Coaches generating $100K-$500K annually showed the highest conversion rates. Below $100K, PR feels like a luxury rather than an investment. Above $500K, many coaches have existing PR relationships or in-house capability. The $100K-$500K range is where the credibility gap between current revenue and potential pricing is most acutely felt.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How did leads arrive pre-educated on the investment model?">
    By framing every outreach touchpoint around ROI rather than coverage, prospects who booked calls had already internalized the investment framework. They weren't asking "will you get me press?" — they were asking "how quickly will the PR investment show up in my inbound pipeline?" This pre-education compressed sales cycles and improved close rates.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What was the cost per acquired client?">
    Cost per acquired client was $720 ($7,200 / 10 clients). With average client value of $8,400 ($84,000 / 10 clients), each $720 in acquisition cost returned $8,400 in revenue — an 11.67x return on ad spend calculated on cash collected.

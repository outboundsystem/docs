# FireVibe — 5.7x ROI

FireVibe went from 3-10 inconsistent monthly leads to 15 qualified meetings and 2 closed deals in a single month. The unlock was simple: instead of pitching "we build websites," every prospect received industry-specific portfolio links matched to their vertical. A restaurant owner saw restaurant sites. A med spa owner saw med spa sites. More pipeline in 30 days than the previous quarter of networking.

## The Challenge

FireVibe had a strong portfolio of 50+ live websites but no systematic way to get it in front of the right people. Growth was entirely dependent on unpredictable referrals — 3 to 10 leads per month with zero predictability. Revenue planning was impossible without a consistent pipeline source.

Networking events, referral requests, and generic outreach leading with "we build websites" rather than showing relevant work matched to each prospect's vertical had produced inconsistent results for years.

**Before Outbound System:**
- 3-10 inconsistent leads per month from networking
- No systematic outbound pipeline
- Portfolio of 50+ live sites with no scalable distribution
- Revenue forecasting impossible due to referral dependency

**After Outbound System:**
- 15 qualified meetings booked in a single month
- 2 new clients closed within 30 days
- 20 interested responses from targeted outreach
- More pipeline in 1 month than previous quarter of networking

## The Solution

The key insight was relevance at the portfolio level. LinkedIn Sales Navigator with advanced Boolean filtering isolated SMB owners with outdated websites. Every prospect received industry-specific portfolio links — not a generic agency pitch, but proof from their exact vertical.

### Cold Email

Personalized 4-step sequences to SMB owners under $1M revenue, each featuring vertical-matched portfolio links and social proof from 50+ live implementations.

### LinkedIn Outreach

Relationship-building channel with connection requests and profile engagement warming prospects before email drove the direct meeting ask.

### Beyond the Meetings

- **Market Intelligence:** Boolean filtering revealed med spa and wellness businesses were 3x more responsive than general retail, reshaping FireVibe's ideal client profile.
- **Pipeline Insurance:** Email and LinkedIn in parallel doubled touchpoint coverage, ensuring prospects who missed email still saw FireVibe's portfolio through LinkedIn.
- **ICP Refinement:** Businesses with no web presence converted faster than those with outdated sites, suggesting the "blank slate" pitch was stronger than the "upgrade" pitch.
- **Scalable Social Proof:** 50+ live sites, systematically matched to prospect verticals, functioned as a reusable proof asset that made every cold outreach feel warm.

# Ammo Studio — 11.7x ROI

Ammo Studio signed 10 new AI clients in 5 months by targeting funded companies with ".AI" domains and leading with demo conversion problems, not design capabilities. 78 qualified responses per month proved the approach at scale — every email showed prospects what their site could look like, not what Ammo could do. The simple .AI domain filter turned out to be one of the most effective targeting signals in any campaign.

## The Challenge

AI startups have a universal problem: brilliant technology that nobody understands from the homepage. Poor demo conversion rates caused by landing pages that fail to translate complex technology into clear value propositions. Standard "we design websites" outreach doesn't resonate with technical founders who dismiss generic vendor pitches instantly.

Generic web design outreach leading with capabilities rather than addressing the specific conversion problem AI startups face was producing no systematic pipeline.

**Before Outbound System:**
- Generic "we design websites" outreach failing
- No systematic targeting of funded AI companies
- Before/after portfolio assets not used in prospecting
- No problem-specific messaging around demo conversion rates

**After Outbound System:**
- 10 new AI clients signed in 5 months
- 78 qualified responses per month on average
- ".AI" domain targeting identifying high-fit prospects
- Before/after examples driving meeting bookings at scale

## The Solution

Prospect lists filtered for funded companies with ".AI" domains — a simple but effective signal that AI is core to their identity and they need a site that explains what they do. Multi-provider verification ensured outreach reached technical founders and product leaders. Every sequence included specific before/after examples of AI company site redesigns.

### Cold Email

Primary channel through enterprise infrastructure (2 USA IPs, 100 Outlook inboxes on Azure). Led with the demo conversion problem, not design capabilities. Before/after examples let prospects see the transformation rather than read about it.

### LinkedIn Outreach

Reinforced email campaigns by engaging with prospects' content and sharing design insights relevant to the AI space, building familiarity before the meeting ask.

### Beyond the Meetings

- **Market Intelligence:** The ".AI" domain filter proved a simple but highly effective targeting signal, identifying companies that self-select as AI-first and therefore have the specific web needs Ammo addresses.
- **Pipeline Insurance:** Email and LinkedIn in parallel ensured technical founders who are selective about email still encountered Ammo Studio through LinkedIn content engagement.
- **ICP Refinement:** Recently funded AI startups (within 6 months of a round) showed the highest conversion, as they had budget allocated for brand and marketing infrastructure.
- **Visual Proof-First Selling:** Before/after examples of AI company redesigns let prospects see the transformation, creating 78 responses/month at scale.

# Telescope — 594% ROI

Telescope spent \$7,200 over 4 months and generated \$50,000 in revenue — a 594% ROI — booking 10 meetings with enterprise CPG brands in a market where buying decisions move deliberately. Beyond pipeline, the campaign helped Telescope refine their entire sales messaging based on prospect response data. A 21% reply rate in enterprise CPG is strong in a vertical known for slow vendor evaluation.

## The Challenge

Enterprise CPG brands run sweepstakes and engagement campaigns constantly, but the buying process is notoriously slow and vendor-cautious. Fortune 500 marketing leaders evaluate vendors over months, not days.

Traditional sales messaging didn't quantify interactive participation results from comparable brands or address the specific engagement metrics CPG marketing leaders track. Outreach needed enough credibility to earn a spot on the evaluation list.

**Before Outbound System:**

- Traditional sales messaging underperforming with enterprise CPG
- No quantified engagement lift data from comparable campaigns
- Slow enterprise buying cycle with no systematic outbound
- Sales messaging not optimized for CPG marketing language

**After Outbound System:**

- 10 meetings in 4 months with major CPG brands
- 21% reply rate (strong for enterprise CPG)
- Campaign data refining sales messaging in real time
- Multi-channel approach building awareness before meeting ask

## The Solution

Six-source verified prospect lists targeted marketing leaders at CPG brands with active consumer engagement programs. Enterprise Azure infrastructure ensured Fortune 500 delivery.

### Cold Email

Led with interactive participation success stories from comparable brands, quantifying engagement lift and consumer data capture from specific campaigns in CPG categories.

### LinkedIn Outreach

Targeted marketing leaders with content about consumer engagement trends, building platform awareness before the email ask arrived.

### AI Cold Calling

Deployed for the largest CPG accounts where a brief conversation about engagement campaign goals could accelerate the evaluation process.

### Beyond the Meetings

- **Market Intelligence:** CPG brands with active promotion programs showed 3x the engagement of brands in maintenance mode, confirming active budget is the strongest signal.
- **Sales Message Optimization:** The campaign functioned as a real-time messaging laboratory, with prospect feedback improving Telescope's positioning for all channels.
- **Enterprise Delivery:** Infrastructure ensuring Fortune 500 inbox delivery meant outreach reached the strictest corporate email environments.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why is the cost per meeting $720 for this campaign?">
    Enterprise CPG meetings command higher costs because the audience is small (Fortune 500 marketing leaders), hard to reach (aggressive corporate filters), and slow to engage (deliberate evaluation processes). The \$720 cost per meeting is justified by enterprise deal sizes that can exceed six figures per engagement.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How did the campaign improve Telescope's sales messaging?">
    Prospect response data and feedback throughout the 4-month engagement revealed which value propositions resonated and which fell flat. The campaign functioned as a real-time messaging laboratory, with learnings applied across Telescope's entire sales approach — not just outbound.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Is a 21% reply rate good for enterprise CPG?">
    A 21% reply rate in enterprise CPG is strong. Fortune 500 marketing leaders receive heavy vendor outreach and evaluate slowly. Breaking through requires enterprise-grade infrastructure for delivery and messaging that speaks directly to engagement metrics these leaders track.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What types of CPG brands engaged?">
    Brands with active consumer engagement programs — those running promotions, loyalty campaigns, or interactive content. Brands in maintenance mode showed one-third the engagement, confirming that active budget allocation is the primary buying signal.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How is the $50,000 revenue calculated?">
    Cash collected from deals closed through the campaign over 4 months. $50,000 from $7,200 spend equals a 6.94x return, or 594% ROI. Even as the lowest ROI tier in the portfolio, this still represents a nearly 6x return.

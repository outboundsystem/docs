## The Snapshot

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Industry | Branding & Design / Crypto |
| Company Size | 20-50 employees |
| Services Used | Cold Email + LinkedIn |
| Campaign Duration | 2 months |

## The Challenge

Crypto projects live or die on trust, and trust in a space plagued by scams starts with professional branding. Jacob Tyler needed to reach founders at the exact moment branding matters most — and navigate an inbox where every message is a pitch from a "Web3 marketing agency."

Reaching crypto founders requires navigating the most spam-heavy inbox environment in B2B. Standard branding agency outreach without crypto-stage-specific messaging or funding-timed targeting was getting lost alongside the noise of scam-adjacent pitches.

**Before Outbound System:**
- Standard branding pitches lost in crypto inbox noise
- No funding-stage targeting for crypto projects
- No stage-specific messaging (pre-launch vs. post-launch)
- Trust barrier from scam-heavy market environment

**After Outbound System:**
- 30 meetings booked in just 2 months
- 32% reply rate from crypto founders and CMOs
- Funding-stage targeting reaching projects at branding decision moments
- Credibility-first positioning cutting through crypto noise

## The Solution

Prospect lists used funding round data and token launch timelines to identify projects when branding matters most: post-funding preparing for market, or pre-token-launch when public perception directly impacts valuation. Multi-provider verification ensured outreach reached founders and CMOs, not community managers.

### Cold Email

Stage-tied messaging: pre-launch focused on market positioning, post-launch focused on trust-building and community perception. Led with credibility as the core value proposition, not design capabilities. Enterprise Azure infrastructure penetrated aggressive crypto spam filters.

### LinkedIn Outreach

Targeted crypto founders with engagement around Web3 brand strategy content, creating familiarity and trust before any direct pitch about design services.

### Beyond the Meetings

- **Market Intelligence:** Funding round and token launch timing data revealed the optimal branding decision windows, creating a predictable outreach calendar aligned with crypto project milestones.
- **Pipeline Insurance:** LinkedIn engagement built trust before email arrived — critical in a market where cold email from unknown senders faces maximum skepticism.
- **ICP Refinement:** Post-funding projects (vs. pre-funding) showed 2x the engagement rate, validating that budget availability is the primary driver of branding investment decisions in crypto.

<Tip>

Reaching projects at the exact moment branding becomes critical (post-funding, pre-launch) meant outreach arrived as a relevant resource rather than unwanted spam. Timing is everything in crypto outbound.

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="How did Jacob Tyler achieve a 32% reply rate in the crypto market?">
    Two mechanisms: funding-stage timing and credibility-first messaging. Projects post-funding and pre-launch are actively evaluating branding — outreach arrives at the exact decision moment rather than interrupting an unrelated workflow. Leading with credibility (how professional branding impacts token valuation and community trust) rather than design capabilities spoke to what crypto founders actually care about.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why did post-funding projects outperform pre-funding?">
    Post-funding projects showed 2x the engagement rate because they have budget allocated and a concrete timeline for market launch. Pre-funding projects may want branding but lack the resources to invest. The funding event is the trigger that converts branding from "would be nice" to "need this before launch."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How was $120 cost per meeting achieved in a difficult market?">
    Jacob Tyler's $120 cost per meeting is among the lowest across all 44 campaigns — remarkable given crypto is one of the hardest outbound markets. The efficiency came from precise timing (reaching projects at the exact branding decision moment), high reply rates (32%), and a 2-month campaign that minimized cost while maximizing concentrated results.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How did LinkedIn help build trust before email?">
    In crypto, unknown senders face maximum skepticism. LinkedIn engagement with founders' content about Web3 strategy, token launches, and community building created name recognition before any email arrived. When a founder sees Jacob Tyler's name in their inbox and recognizes it from LinkedIn, the email gets opened instead of deleted.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What stage of crypto project is ideal for branding investment?">
    The optimal window is post-funding, pre-public launch. The project has capital from its funding round, a concrete timeline for going to market, and the understanding that public perception will directly impact their launch success. Projects in this window are actively making branding decisions — outreach at this moment is relevant, not intrusive.

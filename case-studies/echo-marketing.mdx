## The Challenge

Echo came after getting burned by another cold email agency. Zero results, wasted budget, and a sales team that had lost confidence in outbound entirely. The target was universities struggling with student recruitment — a niche where decision-makers are notoriously hard to reach and trust in outbound had been destroyed by the previous failure.

The previous cold email agency delivered zero results and wasted budget. The failed experience left Echo's sales team skeptical that outbound could work at all for higher education buyers.

**Before Outbound System:**
- Previous agency delivered zero results
- Wasted budget on failed outbound experiment
- Sales team lost confidence in outbound as a channel
- No systematic way to reach university admissions leaders

**After Outbound System:**
- 32 qualified leads in 3 months
- 26 meetings booked with university decision-makers
- First agency to actually deliver on lead gen goals
- Sales team confidence in outbound fully restored

## The Solution

Trust in outbound had to be rebuilt. The team mapped the higher education landscape for institutions with declining enrollment, recent admissions leadership changes, or public recruitment challenges. These intent signals identified who was actively feeling pain — not just who fit a demographic profile.

### Cold Email

Primary driver with sequences personalized to each prospect's institution and specific enrollment context. Built around Echo's track record with disruptive enrollment campaigns. First qualified leads arrived within 7 days.

### LinkedIn Outreach

Secondary channel engaging admissions and marketing leaders at target universities with higher education content, building familiarity before the email ask.

### AI Cold Calling

Deployed selectively for institutions showing the strongest intent signals, providing a direct touchpoint email alone couldn't achieve with hard-to-reach admissions leaders.

### Beyond the Meetings

- **Market Intelligence:** Campaign data mapped which institution types (community colleges vs. private universities) had faster response cycles, giving Echo a data-driven expansion roadmap.
- **Pipeline Insurance:** After the previous agency's failure, multi-channel coverage ensured no single channel failure could tank the entire program.
- **ICP Refinement:** Institutions with recent leadership changes in admissions responded at 3x the rate of stable teams, enabling sharper targeting in subsequent campaigns.
- **Credibility Restoration:** By delivering where the previous agency failed, the campaign restored Echo's internal confidence in outbound and validated the channel for future investment.

## Get Results Like Echo Marketing

Echo's campaign proved that outbound works in higher education when you target intent signals (declining enrollment, leadership changes) rather than demographics alone. If you've been burned by a previous [lead generation agency](/knowledge-base/lead-gen-agency-comparison) and lost confidence in outbound, the problem was likely infrastructure and targeting — not the channel itself. See how our [cold email service](/services/cold-email) builds deliverability-first campaigns that actually land in inboxes.

# 3rd Degree Screening — 19x ROI

3rd Degree Screening closed 3 enterprise clients in 30 days with a 24% response rate. The shift from commodity positioning (price and speed) to compliance risk messaging elevated every conversation. Instead of competing on who's cheapest and fastest, outreach led with the liability exposure companies face when background checks are slow, inconsistent, or incomplete — a framing that made HR directors lean in instead of delete.

## The Challenge

Background check services are a crowded market where most vendors compete on price and speed. Commodity positioning made differentiation impossible. The real angle was compliance risk: the liability exposure companies face when background checks are slow, inconsistent, or incomplete — but no outbound messaging was surfacing that pain.

Price-and-speed-focused outreach that positioned background checks as a commodity service rather than a compliance and risk management solution was producing no enterprise client acquisitions.

**Before Outbound System:**
- Commodity positioning in a crowded market
- No compliance-risk-focused messaging framework
- No intent-signal targeting based on hiring volume
- No enterprise client acquisitions from outbound

**After Outbound System:**
- 15+ qualified leads in 30 days
- 3 new enterprise clients closed within the month
- 24% response rate from HR decision-makers
- Compliance-risk messaging elevating every conversation above commodity competition

## The Solution

Targeting used a specific intent signal: companies posting 10+ job openings per month — a clear indicator of active hiring volume and background check needs. Six-provider waterfall verification ensured reach to actual HR decision-makers. Enterprise infrastructure maintained 98% deliverability into corporate HR email environments.

### Cold Email

Led with compliance risk and liability exposure, then pivoted to 3rd Degree's 24-hour turnaround as the solution. Each sequence included a relevant client example matched to the prospect's industry. The reframe from "we're fast and cheap" to "here's what non-compliance costs you" changed the entire sales dynamic.

### AI Cold Calling

Targeted HR directors at the highest-volume hiring companies with brief, compliance-focused scripts that created urgency around risk exposure without being pushy. A 60-second call about liability was more effective than any email about turnaround time.

### Beyond the Meetings

- **Market Intelligence:** The 10+ job postings signal proved the single strongest predictor of background check buying intent, creating a scalable and repeatable targeting framework.
- **Pipeline Insurance:** Email and calling together ensured HR directors who don't respond to vendor emails were still reached through direct phone conversations about compliance.
- **ICP Refinement:** Companies posting for customer-facing roles (sales, support) showed the highest urgency for thorough background checks, refining the messaging angle further.
- **Risk-Based Differentiation:** Compliance-risk messaging elevated conversations beyond price and speed, positioning 3rd Degree as a risk management solution rather than a commodity vendor.

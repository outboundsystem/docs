# Growth Squad — 900% ROI

Growth Squad invested $3,600 over 2 months and generated $36,000 in cash-collected revenue — a 900% ROI. The campaign booked 18 qualified meetings with 41 responses per month, including multiple 5-lead days. In a Web3 market where everyone claims expertise, challenge-specific messaging that addressed community activation plateaus and token holder engagement decay separated signal from noise.

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Industry | Blockchain / Web3 Marketing |
| Company Size | 10-50 employees |
| Services Used | Cold Email + LinkedIn |
| Campaign Duration | 2 months |

## The Challenge

Web3 companies operate in a market where everyone claims expertise but few can demonstrate it. Growth Squad needed outreach that immediately separated them from the noise of crypto marketing agencies making hollow promises.

The Web3 marketing space is flooded with agencies making vague growth claims. Outreach needed to demonstrate specific understanding of Web3 growth challenges — not generic digital marketing capabilities. Generic agency outreach without Web3-specific challenge messaging was getting deleted alongside scam pitches.

**Before Outbound System:**
- Generic agency positioning in a noise-heavy Web3 market
- No Web3-specific challenge messaging
- No targeting based on post-funding growth inflection signals
- No systematic pipeline for crypto companies

**After Outbound System:**
- 18 qualified meetings in just 2 months
- 41 qualified responses per month on average
- Multiple 5-lead days validating targeting precision
- Web3-challenge-specific messaging earning conversations

## The Solution

Six-source verification targeted Web3 companies at a specific growth inflection: post-token launch or post-funding, with active communities but stagnant user or transaction growth. These signals identified companies that had traction but needed strategic marketing to scale past the initial plateau.

### Cold Email

Led with Web3-specific challenges: community activation plateaus, token holder engagement decay, blockchain-to-mainstream user acquisition. Each sequence referenced Growth Squad's experience with comparable Web3 clients. Enterprise Azure infrastructure penetrated aggressive crypto spam filters.

### LinkedIn Outreach

Particularly strong channel for this audience. Web3 founders and growth leads are highly active on LinkedIn, and content engagement created warm rapport before any direct outreach arrived.

### Beyond the Meetings

- **Market Intelligence:** Growth inflection targeting (post-launch/post-funding with stagnant growth) proved the strongest signal, identifying companies with both the need and the budget for marketing support.
- **Pipeline Insurance:** LinkedIn and email in parallel ensured Web3 founders who filter heavily on email still encountered Growth Squad through organic LinkedIn engagement.
- **ICP Refinement:** Companies with active communities but stagnant transaction growth showed 3x the engagement of pre-launch projects, validating the post-traction targeting thesis.

<Tip>

Multiple 5-lead days demonstrated that when targeting and messaging align precisely, pipeline arrives in concentrated bursts rather than a slow trickle — a sign the ICP definition is exactly right.

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="How did Growth Squad's messaging cut through Web3 noise?">
    By leading with specific Web3 challenges rather than generic marketing capabilities. Community activation plateaus, token holder engagement decay, and blockchain-to-mainstream user acquisition are problems Web3 founders feel daily. Naming these challenges specifically — instead of pitching "growth marketing" — immediately demonstrated that Growth Squad understood their world. In a market full of vague promises, specificity is the differentiator.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What does a '5-lead day' indicate about targeting quality?">
    Concentrated lead days occur when targeting precision is extremely high — a large portion of the prospect list matches the ICP exactly, so responses cluster rather than trickling in. Multiple 5-lead days mean the Web3 growth inflection signal (post-traction with stagnant growth) was identifying the right companies at the right moment with high consistency.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why was LinkedIn particularly strong for Web3?">
    Web3 founders and growth leads are among the most active professional audiences on LinkedIn. They post frequently about growth challenges, community metrics, and marketing experiments. This activity creates natural engagement opportunities — commenting on their posts and sharing relevant insights — that build rapport before any direct outreach. The warm rapport from LinkedIn made email outreach feel like a continuation of an existing conversation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What growth stage of Web3 company converted best?">
    Post-token launch or post-funding companies with active communities but stagnant user or transaction growth showed 3x the engagement of pre-launch projects. These companies have proven traction (the community exists) but need strategic marketing to scale. They also have budget from their launch or funding round to invest in marketing support.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How did Azure infrastructure help with crypto spam filters?">
    Crypto company inboxes have some of the most aggressive spam filtering in B2B, thanks to the volume of scam and spam targeting the space. Enterprise Azure infrastructure with dedicated U.S. IPs and 100 Outlook inboxes maintained deliverability through MX-based routing, ensuring Growth Squad's outreach landed in primary inboxes rather than being filtered alongside the noise.

# Veritas Ads — 956% ROI

Veritas Ads spent $3,600 over 2 months and generated $38,000 in revenue — a 956% ROI — by localizing every outreach metric to the prospect's specific trade and metro area. 19 meetings booked with a 42% reply rate from local service business owners who jumped on calls immediately because the outreach had already pre-sold the conversation.

**$3,600 invested. $38,000 in revenue. 42% reply rate.** Most prospects jumped on a phone call immediately — the localized outreach pre-sold the value before any conversation.

## The Challenge

Local service businesses (plumbers, dentists, law firms) make a simple buying decision: "can you get me more customers in my area?" Outreach had to answer that question immediately with local proof.

Generic "grow your business" pitches fail with local operators. They need localized, trade-specific proof from businesses they recognize as peers in their metro area. Broad targeting without trade and geography segmentation meant messaging never resonated.

**Before Outbound System:**

- Generic "grow your business" messaging for local operators
- No trade-specific or metro-localized proof points
- No multi-channel approach for phone-oriented local businesses
- Broad targeting without trade and geography segmentation

**After Outbound System:**

- 19 meetings booked in 2 months
- 42% reply rate from local service business owners
- Trade and metro-localized proof driving conversations
- Most prospects eager to jump on a call immediately

## The Solution

Prospect lists of local service business owners segmented by trade and metro area for hyper-specific messaging. AI calling was a natural fit: local business owners are phone-oriented and respond to brief, direct conversations.

### Cold Email

Sequences led with local market dominance proof. Not "we'll grow your business" but "here's how a plumbing company in your metro went from 15 to 45 leads per month." Every metric was localized and trade-specific.

### AI Cold Calling

Natural fit for phone-oriented local business owners. Calls timed for late morning when owners have handled first appointments and have a window to talk about growth.

### LinkedIn Outreach

Lighter third channel for business owners with active profiles, supplementing primary email and phone outreach.

### Beyond the Meetings

- **Market Intelligence:** Trade and metro segmentation revealed which local service verticals had the highest response rates in specific metros.
- **ICP Refinement:** Business owners with 2-5 years in operation showed the highest engagement — the point where they've validated the business and are ready to invest in growth.
- **Pre-Sold Conversations:** Most prospects jumped on a call immediately, indicating localized outreach had already pre-sold the value.

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="Why did localized messaging produce a 42% reply rate?">
    Local business owners respond to proof from their exact market. Telling a Denver plumber how a Denver plumber grew from 15 to 45 leads per month is categorically different from generic "we help plumbers grow." The specificity creates instant credibility and relevance.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why was AI calling effective for this audience?">
    Local service business owners are phone-oriented — they run their businesses from their phones between jobs. Email alone misses a significant portion of this audience. Calls timed for late morning (after first appointments) catch owners when they have a window for growth conversations.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What types of local service businesses responded best?">
    Response rates varied by metro and trade, but businesses with 2-5 years of operation consistently showed the highest engagement across categories. At this stage, the business model is proven and owners are ready to invest in systematic customer acquisition.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How quickly did prospects convert to calls?">
    Most prospects jumped on a phone call immediately upon responding — within the same day in many cases. This speed-to-call reflects the quality of targeting and messaging. When local business owners see relevant local proof, they act fast.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How is the $38,000 revenue verified?">
    Cash collected from deals closed through the campaign over 2 months. $38,000 from $3,600 spend equals a 10.56x return, or 956% ROI. Revenue reflects actual money received, not projected value.

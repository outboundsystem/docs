# AI Cold Calling Pricing Guide: What Every Option Actually Costs

AI cold calling costs between 0.07 and 2.00 per minute depending on the model you choose, but per-minute pricing tells you almost nothing about what you'll actually spend. The real cost depends on whether you build it yourself, hire a managed service, outsource to a traditional agency, or hire in-house — and each path has hidden expenses vendors don't highlight on their pricing pages. This guide breaks down the true total cost of ownership across every option with current vendor pricing, hidden cost checklists, and an ROI calculation framework so you know exactly what to budget.

## What Are the Four Ways to Run AI Cold Calling (and What Does Each Cost)?

Every AI cold calling deployment falls into one of four models: DIY platforms, managed services, traditional human agencies, or in-house SDR teams. The sticker price gap between them is enormous — 12K to 218K per year — but cost per qualified meeting tells a completely different story than cost per minute.

### Option 1: DIY AI Voice Platforms

You pick a platform, build your own AI agent, configure scripts, connect telephony, and manage everything internally. Cheapest on paper, most complex in practice.

**Current per-minute rates across major platforms:**

| Platform   | Per-Minute Rate | Platform Fee       | What's Included                                        |
| ---------- | --------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Retell AI  | \$0.07+         | None               | Voice engine, LLM, telephony bundled                   |
| Vapi AI    | \$0.05+         | Separate fees      | Modular — voice, LLM, telephony each billed separately |
| Bland AI   | \$0.09          | None               | Connected call minutes, basic features                 |
| Synthflow  | \$0.08+         | Subscription tiers | No-code builder, CRM integrations                      |
| Tabbly     | \$0.08          | None               | Pay-as-you-go with committed plans                     |
| ElevenLabs | \$0.10+         | Volume plans       | Premium voice quality                                  |

Those per-minute rates look compelling — until you layer in everything that doesn't appear on the pricing page.

<Warning>
  Most DIY operators underestimate prompt engineering costs by 5–10x. Writing a cold calling script for an AI agent is fundamentally different from writing a human script. Expect 15–25 hours of setup and 5–10 hours/month of ongoing optimization at $75–$150/hour — that's $1,125–$3,750 for initial setup alone.
</Warning>

**The hidden costs of DIY AI cold calling:**

**Telephony infrastructure.** Most platforms charge voice engine fees separately from carrier costs. US voice calls run $0.005–$0.02/min through Twilio, Telnyx, or Vonage. You also need phone numbers at $1–$2/number/month, and for outbound at scale, number rotation pools of 20–50+ numbers to avoid spam flagging — that's $20–$100/month in number rental alone.

**LLM costs (if unbundled).** GPT-4o and Claude run $0.03–$0.06/min of conversation. Cheaper models (GPT-3.5, open-source) run $0.006–$0.01/min but produce noticeably worse conversation quality — more robotic responses, weaker objection handling, higher prospect detection rates. Model choice directly impacts qualification accuracy.

**Voice engine fees (if unbundled).** ElevenLabs conversational AI runs approximately 0.10/min. Deepgram STT sits around 0.01–0.02/min. OpenAI's voice engine: 0.07–\$0.08/min. Voice quality is the first thing a prospect evaluates — cutting corners here increases hang-ups.

**Prompt engineering and script optimization.** This is the cost nobody budgets for, and it's the most important variable in the entire system. It's easy to write a prompt that sounds acceptable in testing. It's extremely difficult to engineer a prompt that handles the 47 different ways a real prospect says "I'm not interested" and still books meetings at 2%+ conversion rates. This is where the difference between 5 meetings/month and 40 meetings/month lives.

**CRM integration.** Connecting your AI agent to HubSpot, Salesforce, or Pipedrive requires native integrations (often limited), middleware like Make or Zapier ($50–$200/month), or custom development.

**Compliance management.** TCPA compliance, DNC list scrubbing, state-specific consent requirements, call recording disclosures — none of this is optional. Either you handle it internally or you accept the risk of $500–$1,500 fines per violation. The FCC ruling classifying AI-generated voices as "artificial" adds specific requirements for calls to mobile phones.

**Realistic monthly cost at 10,000 minutes:**

| Component                                  | Monthly Cost |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------ |
| Platform/voice minutes (10K × $0.07–$0.15) | $700–$1,500  |
| Telephony/carrier costs                    | $50–$200     |
| Phone number rotation pool                 | $20–$100     |
| LLM costs (if separate)                    | $60–$600     |
| Prompt engineering/optimization            | $375–$1,500  |
| CRM integration/middleware                 | $50–$200     |
| Compliance tooling                         | $100–$300    |
| **Monthly total**                          | **4,400**    |
| **Annual total**                           | **52,800**   |

Add initial setup costs of 2,000–5,000 for prompt engineering, integration development, and compliance configuration. Budget for the learning curve: most DIY operators spend 30–60 days before their agent performs at an acceptable level, during which you're burning through your lead list at sub-optimal conversion rates.

<Info>
  DIY is best for companies with technical talent in-house who can manage prompts, integrations, and telephony — with call volumes above 5,000 minutes/month and willingness to iterate for 1–2 months before peak performance.
</Info>

### Option 2: Managed AI Calling Services

A provider builds, optimizes, and operates your AI calling system for you. You provide ICP criteria and approve messaging. They handle everything else.

Monthly retainer models are most common, typically 999–2,500/month for SMB operations, scaling with dial volume. Some providers charge per meeting booked ($50–$200/meeting), and hybrids combine a base fee with per-meeting bonuses.

| Plan    | Monthly Cost  | Daily Dials   | What's Included                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Starter | \$999/month   | Up to 250/day | AI agent build, script writing, target list, DNC scrubbing, CRM integration, real-time dashboard, dedicated US account manager, call recording, weekly optimization |
| Scale   | \$1,999/month | Up to 500/day | Everything in Starter + higher volume, additional ICP segments, monthly strategy sessions                                                                           |

Month-to-month contracts. No 3–6 month lock-ins. Live in 5 days. That last point matters more than it seems — every day your campaign isn't running is a day of meetings you're not booking.

**What's typically included in managed services:** AI agent build and ongoing script optimization, telephony infrastructure and phone number management, target list building with verified phone data, DNC/TCPA compliance at infrastructure level, CRM integration, call recording and verification, real-time performance dashboards, and regular optimization cycles on a weekly cadence.

**Why managed services outperform DIY on cost-per-meeting despite higher sticker prices:** A managed provider built on data from thousands of campaigns has already tested thousands of opening lines, objection responses, call timing strategies, and ICP segment approaches. They know, from aggregate data, that certain opener frameworks convert 3x better than others for specific industries. That intelligence is baked into your campaign from day one. A DIY operator starts from zero — and burns leads at below-optimal conversion during the 30–60 day learning curve.

<Tip>
  Annual cost for managed AI calling: $12,000–$24,000. Best for companies that want results without building internal AI operations capabilities. Most managed services report meetings booked within the first week and positive ROI within 30–60 days.
</Tip>

### Option 3: Traditional Outbound Agencies (Human Callers)

Agencies employing human SDRs to call on your behalf. These predate AI calling and remain common for enterprise-focused outreach.

| Pricing Model                                        | Typical Range       |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Monthly retainer (1 dedicated/semi-dedicated caller) | $4,000–$8,000/month |
| Per meeting booked                                   | $200–$500/meeting   |
| Per MQL generated                                    | $50–$150/lead       |
| Contract length                                      | 3–6 months typical  |
| **Annual cost**                                      | **96,000**          |

**What human agencies offer that AI doesn't (yet):** genuine conversational adaptability on complex calls, real-time prospect research and personalization based on unstructured information, relationship continuity over multiple touches, and more natural handling of highly technical conversations.

**What human agencies consistently struggle with:** consistency — agent quality varies by day and by how many rejections they've absorbed. Scale — adding capacity means hiring, which takes weeks. Transparency — many agencies deliver monthly PDF reports rather than real-time dashboards, and "dedicated" callers often split time across 2–4 clients. Your campaign gets 25–50% of one person's attention.

Best for enterprise-focused companies with \$75K+ ACV, complex products requiring technical discovery, or industries where AI voice calling faces regulatory constraints.

### Option 4: In-House SDR Team

Hire, train, manage, and retain your own sales development representatives.

| Component                     | Annual Cost Per SDR |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Base salary + OTE             | $75,000–$105,000    |
| Benefits and payroll taxes    | $14,225–$28,955     |
| Sales tech stack per seat     | $7,500–$18,000      |
| Management allocation         | $13,000–$25,000     |
| Recruiting (amortized)        | $3,400–$10,700      |
| Ramp period productivity loss | $12,850–$25,700     |
| Workspace and infrastructure  | $2,000–$5,000       |
| **Total loaded cost**         | **218,000**         |

A fully ramped SDR books 8–15 qualified meetings per month. At 170K midpoint and 12 meetings/month, that's 1,180 per meeting. Only 18% of SDRs consistently hit quota. Average tenure: 14–18 months. You absorb recruiting ($4K–$15K) and ramp ($15K–$30K) costs with each turnover cycle.

## Cost Per Qualified Meeting: The Comparison That Connects to Revenue

Per-minute rates are a red herring. The metric that maps to pipeline is cost per qualified meeting booked.

| Channel              | Annual Cost | Meetings/Month | Cost/Meeting | Time to First Meeting | Scalability               |
| -------------------- | ----------- | -------------- | ------------ | --------------------- | ------------------------- |
| DIY AI platform      | $16K–$53K   | 15–40          | $33–$294     | 30–60 days            | High (add minutes)        |
| Managed AI service   | $12K–$36K   | 20–40+         | $25–$150     | 5–14 days             | High (upgrade plan)       |
| Human calling agency | $48K–$96K   | 5–10           | $400–$1,600  | 14–30 days            | Low (hire more callers)   |
| In-house SDR         | $128K–$218K | 8–15           | $711–$1,389  | 90–120 days           | Very low (recruit + ramp) |

<Info>
  Managed AI services deliver 3x–10x lower cost per meeting than in-house SDRs, with faster launch and higher scalability. Even compared to human agencies, AI delivers 2x–4x more meetings per dollar.
</Info>

## When Cheaper Per-Minute Doesn't Mean Cheaper Per-Meeting

A 25 AI-booked meeting that never converts is more expensive than a 500 human-booked meeting that closes a \$100K deal. Cost per meeting only matters if the meetings are actually qualified.

AI-booked meetings typically have strong structured qualification — the AI follows BANT/MEDDIC criteria without exception and logs complete data. Meeting show rates from AI-booked appointments are comparable to human-booked when the AI is well-calibrated, typically 60–75%.

However, AI-booked meetings may carry less conversational context — the nuanced observations an experienced SDR captures about a prospect's specific situation or competitive landscape. For products under 50K ACV with straightforward value propositions, this context gap rarely affects downstream conversion. For enterprise deals above 75K ACV, richer meeting context correlates with higher opportunity-to-close rates.

**The practical takeaway:** AI cold calling delivers strongest ROI for companies selling products under \$50K ACV to large addressable markets. As ACV increases and deal complexity grows, hybrid models — AI for volume qualification, humans for high-value accounts — become optimal.

## The Hidden Cost Checklist: What to Ask Before You Sign

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Questions for DIY Platforms">
    **Before committing to any DIY platform, get answers to these 7 questions:**

    What's the effective per-minute rate including LLM, voice engine, and telephony? Many advertise platform cost only, not the all-in rate. At 10,000 minutes/month with the recommended model and voice, what's the actual monthly bill?

    Are there minimum commitments, volume thresholds, or overage rates? Is compliance tooling (DNC scrubbing, consent management, time-zone enforcement) included or separate?

    Which CRM integrations are native versus requiring middleware — and what does middleware cost? What prompt engineering support is provided? Most offer documentation, not hands-on help. How many concurrent calls can you run before needing an enterprise plan?
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Questions for Managed Services">
    **Before signing with any managed AI calling provider, get answers to these 10 questions:**

    How exactly is "qualified meeting" defined? What disqualifies one? Who owns the call recordings and prospect data?

    What's the ramp-up timeline from contract signing to first dials? Is target list building/sourcing included or an add-on? What are the contract terms — monthly or annual commitment?

    What optimization happens after launch — weekly testing or set-and-forget? What does the real-time dashboard show: dials, connections, conversations, meetings, conversion by segment — or just an activity count?

    Can you listen to any call recording on demand? How many clients does the account manager handle? Does the provider run multi-channel (calling + email + LinkedIn), or just calling?
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Questions for All Providers">
    **Regardless of which model you choose, always ask:**

    What's the replacement or credit policy for no-show meetings? How quickly can scripts be updated if messaging or positioning changes?

    What compliance certifications are held (SOC 2, HIPAA if applicable)? Can the provider share case studies with specific numbers from companies in your industry and deal size range?
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## How to Calculate Your Specific ROI

<Steps>
  <Step title="Determine Your Current Cost Per Meeting">
    Take total monthly outbound spend — SDR salaries, tools, agency fees, everything — and divide by qualified meetings booked. This is your baseline. Most companies discover their real cost per meeting is 2–4x higher than they assumed because they've never loaded in management overhead, tech stack, ramp, and turnover costs.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Estimate AI Meeting Volume">
    For a managed AI service at $999–$1,999/month making 250–500 dials/day against a list of 5,000+ qualified contacts:

    Conservative estimate (1.5% dial-to-meeting conversion): 15–25 meetings/month. Average (2.5% conversion): 25–40 meetings/month. Optimized with multi-channel warming (3–4%): 35–55 meetings/month.

    These ranges account for voicemail, wrong numbers, DNC filtering, and connection rate realities. Multi-channel campaigns — where email and LinkedIn warm prospects before the call — consistently push conversion rates toward the higher end.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Calculate Pipeline Value">
    Multiply estimated monthly meetings by your average deal size and historical meeting-to-close rate.

    \*\*Example — B2B SaaS, 25K ACV, 15% close rate:\*\* 30 meetings/month × 25,000 × 15% = \$112,500/month in expected closed revenue.

    \*\*Example — Professional services, $50K engagement, 20% close rate:** 25 meetings/month × $50,000 × 20% = \$250,000/month in expected closed revenue.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Compute ROI">
    Formula: (Monthly pipeline value − monthly AI cost) ÷ monthly AI cost × 100.

    Using the SaaS example: (112,500 − 1,999) ÷ \$1,999 = 5,529% ROI.

    Even discounting the meeting volume by 50% and the close rate by 30% for conservatism, the math overwhelmingly favors AI over human-only approaches for companies with the right profile.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Build the Breakeven Scenario">
    At $999/month with $15,000 average deal size and 10% close rate: you need 0.67 closed deals/month to break even — roughly 7 meetings. At \$1,999/month: 1.33 closed deals/month, or roughly 14 meetings at 10% close rate. Even the most conservative AI calling scenarios exceed both thresholds.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Pricing Red Flags: When to Walk Away

<Warning>
  Watch for these 6 warning signs that signal a provider is obscuring true costs or delivering subpar service.
</Warning>

**"Unlimited" plans with asterisks.** No AI calling platform offers truly unlimited calling. If a vendor advertises "unlimited," find the usage cap buried in terms of service. Some throttle after hitting undisclosed thresholds.

**Per-minute pricing without defining what counts as a "minute."** Does voicemail count? Ring time? Only connected conversations? A platform charging 0.15/min including ring and voicemail time is dramatically more expensive at scale than one charging 0.07/min for connected conversation only.

**No call recording access.** If you can't listen to your AI agent's actual conversations with real prospects, you have no way to evaluate quality, diagnose issues, or provide feedback.

**6-month contracts from providers with no case studies.** Lock-in periods exist to protect the vendor, not you. Month-to-month pricing signals the provider is confident they'll retain you on performance.

**Setup fees above 2,000 for managed services**. Some setup investment is reasonable. But 5,000+ setup fees often indicate either inflated margins or a labor-intensive process that should have been automated.

**No compliance infrastructure.** If a provider can't articulate their DNC scrubbing process, TCPA compliance framework, time-zone dialing enforcement, and disclosure protocols, they're putting your business at legal risk.

## AI Cold Calling Pricing by Business Stage

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Startups ($0–$5M ARR)">
    **Recommended approach:** Start with a managed AI service at $999–$1,999/month to validate ICP, messaging, and conversion rates with real call data. The speed-to-data advantage (5-day launch versus 3-month SDR hire) means you learn faster and preserve capital.

    **Prioritize:** Month-to-month flexibility, fast launch timeline, multi-channel capability (you likely need email + calling, not just calling), and real-time data for weekly ICP iteration.

    **Budget:** $1,000–$2,500/month for managed multi-channel outbound. This replaces a \$170K+ SDR hire and delivers meetings within the first week instead of the first quarter.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Growth Stage ($5M–$50M ARR)">
    **Recommended approach:** Hybrid model. Managed AI calling for volume across your broad ICP at hundreds of dials per day. One to two senior SDRs for enterprise named accounts requiring relationship-first outreach. Multi-channel system running calling + email + LinkedIn against the same prospect segments.

    **Prioritize:** Scalability (can the provider double daily dials when ready?), CRM integration depth (meeting data flowing directly into pipeline), and optimization cadence (weekly testing, not monthly check-ins).

    **Budget:** $2,000–$4,000/month for managed AI calling, plus $170K–$200K/year for 1 senior SDR. Total: approximately $220K–$250K/year for 3–5x the meeting volume of a 3-person SDR team at \$510K/year.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Enterprise ($50M+ ARR)">
    **Recommended approach:** Multi-channel AI outbound for mid-market and SMB segments. Dedicated human SDR team for enterprise named accounts. AI handling lead re-engagement, follow-up, event attendee outreach, and expansion pipeline.

    **Prioritize:** Compliance at scale, multi-segment capability (different scripts and ICPs running simultaneously), enterprise CRM integration (Salesforce enterprise, SFDC flows), and dedicated account management.

    **Budget:** $5,000–$15,000/month for multi-segment AI calling, plus 500K+ for enterprise SDR team. Total: 560K–680K/year generating significantly more pipeline than a 1M+ pure-human SDR organization.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What's the cheapest way to start AI cold calling?">
    The lowest-barrier entry is a DIY platform like Retell AI at $0.07/min with no platform fee. For under $500/month, you can run a small pilot of 5,000–7,000 minutes. Budget an additional $1,000–$2,000 for initial script development and integration. The risk: poor script engineering burns leads at below-optimal conversion, and the learning curve delays meaningful results by 30–60 days. The fastest path to real meetings is a managed service with a month-to-month contract at \$999/month — you're buying speed-to-optimization, not just dial volume.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do AI cold calling costs compare to cold email?">
    Cold email agencies typically charge $2,500–$5,000/month for managed campaigns. AI cold calling managed services overlap at $999–$2,500/month. Voice outreach typically delivers higher connection rates (5–16% versus 1–3% for email) and faster qualification through real-time conversation versus async reply chains. The highest-performing outbound operations run both channels simultaneously — email warms and creates name recognition, calling converts that recognition into meetings. Multi-channel campaigns produce 2–3x the meetings versus either channel alone.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Are there per-call pricing models instead of per-minute?">
    Some providers charge per connected call ($0.50–$2.00) rather than per minute. This works in your favor if calls run long at 7+ minutes but costs more for quick qualification calls under 3 minutes. Per-minute billing is more common and generally more predictable for budgeting.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What's the minimum budget for AI cold calling to make sense?">
    For managed services: $999–$1,500/month minimum to generate meaningful dial volume. For DIY: $500–$800/month in platform costs plus 10–15 hours/month of internal management time. Below these thresholds, you won't generate enough data to be statistically meaningful or enough meetings to impact pipeline.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Does AI cold calling work for both B2B and B2C?">
    Both, but compliance requirements differ significantly. B2B AI calling to business lines faces fewer restrictions. B2C requires prior express consent for calls to mobile phones and must comply with the FCC's AI voice ruling classifying AI-generated voices as "artificial." B2B calling has more regulatory flexibility, though consent-based outreach and DNC compliance remain mandatory.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I know if the pricing I'm quoted is fair?">
    Benchmark against the ranges in this guide. If a managed service quotes above $3,000/month for standard SMB outbound, ask what justifies the premium — multi-channel capability, enterprise compliance, or highly specialized ICP. If a DIY platform's effective rate exceeds $0.20/min after all components, compare alternatives. The market is competitive enough that no vendor should charge more than 2x these ranges without delivering proportionally more value.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What's the biggest indicator of pricing transparency?">
    Whether the provider publishes pricing before a sales call. Providers who list exact tiers with complete feature lists signal confidence in their value delivery. Providers who require a call to learn the price are often obscuring costs, bundling setup fees, or pricing based on perceived willingness-to-pay rather than deliverables. Month-to-month contracts are another strong signal — lock-in periods protect the vendor, not you.

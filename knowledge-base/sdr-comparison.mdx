# In-House SDRs vs Done-For-You Outbound

A single in-house SDR costs $75K-$120K per year fully loaded (salary, benefits, tools, management overhead) and takes 3-6 months to reach full productivity at 50-80 touchpoints per day. A done-for-you outbound service delivers 5,000+ touchpoints per day from day one, with no ramp period, no management burden, and no risk of a single resignation wiping out your pipeline. The math favors done-for-you for most B2B companies under $50M in revenue — here's the full breakdown.

## What Does an In-House SDR Actually Cost?

The salary line item is where most companies start and stop their math. The real cost is 1.5-2x higher once you account for everything required to make that hire productive.

| Cost Category | Annual Cost (Per SDR) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Base salary | $45,000-$65,000 | Varies by market; major metros skew higher |
| Commission/bonus | $10,000-$25,000 | Typically 20-30% of OTE |
| Benefits (health, 401k, PTO) | $12,000-$20,000 | 20-25% of base salary |
| Payroll taxes | $5,000-$8,000 | FICA, state unemployment, workers' comp |
| Sales tools & tech stack | $3,600-$6,000 | CRM, sequencer, dialer, data provider ($200-$400/mo per seat) |
| Laptop & equipment | $1,500-$2,500 | One-time, amortized annually |
| Training & onboarding | $3,000-$5,000 | Internal time + external resources |
| Management overhead | $10,000-$20,000 | Pro-rated cost of SDR manager (1 manager per 6-8 reps) |
| Recruiting costs | $5,000-$15,000 | Amortized across average 14-month SDR tenure |
| **Total fully loaded cost** | **$95,000-$166,500** | **Most companies land at $120,000-$150,000** |

<Info>

The often-quoted "$75K-$120K per SDR" figure typically excludes management overhead and recruiting costs. When you factor in that the average SDR stays 14 months and each departure triggers a new recruiting cycle plus 3-6 months of ramp time, the effective annual cost per productive SDR seat is $120,000-$180,000.

## What Does Done-For-You Outbound Cost?

Done-for-you outbound services typically charge $3,000-$7,500 per month ($36,000-$90,000 annually) and include the entire stack: infrastructure, data, copy, sending, optimization, and reporting. No additional hires, tools, or management time required.

| Cost Category | Done-For-You (Annual) | In-House SDR (Annual) |
|---|---|---|
| Service/salary cost | $36,000-$90,000 | $55,000-$90,000 |
| Tools & infrastructure | Included | $3,600-$6,000 |
| Benefits & taxes | N/A | $17,000-$28,000 |
| Management time | Minimal (1-2 hrs/week) | 5-10 hrs/week of SDR manager |
| Recruiting & turnover costs | N/A | $5,000-$15,000 |
| Training & ramp period | None (day-one execution) | 3-6 months at reduced output |
| **Total annual cost** | **$36,000-$90,000** | **$95,000-$166,500** |
| **Touchpoints per day** | **5,000+** | **50-80** |
| **Time to first meeting** | **Week 1-2** | **Month 2-4** |

The volume difference is the most striking: a done-for-you service running automated multi-channel infrastructure executes 5,000+ touchpoints per day across email, LinkedIn, and phone — the equivalent output of 60-100 SDRs doing manual outreach.

## How Does Performance Compare?

Raw cost is only half the equation. Performance per dollar spent determines actual ROI.

**Ramp time.** An in-house SDR takes 4-6 weeks to learn your product, ICP, and messaging — then another 2-4 months to hit full productivity. During ramp, they're generating minimal pipeline while consuming full salary and management time. Predictable Revenue's data shows it takes 6-12 months from scratch to see regular revenue from a new outbound team. Done-for-you services launch campaigns in week one using proven infrastructure, tested deliverability setups, and copy frameworks refined across hundreds of campaigns.

**Consistency.** An individual SDR has good days and bad days — motivation fluctuates, activity dips during admin tasks, and performance degrades during personal challenges or job searching. Done-for-you outbound runs on infrastructure, not individual effort. Sending volume, follow-up timing, and A/B testing happen automatically regardless of anyone's motivation on a given Tuesday.

**Optimization speed.** A single SDR testing one variable at a time across 50-80 daily touchpoints generates statistically meaningful data slowly — it can take weeks to confirm whether a subject line or call script works. Done-for-you services running 5,000+ daily touchpoints across multiple campaigns generate optimization data in days, not weeks. They identify winning copy, optimal send times, and responsive segments 5-10x faster.

**Deliverability expertise.** Email deliverability is where most in-house outbound programs break. Domain warming, SPF/DKIM/DMARC configuration, inbox rotation, bounce management, and spam trap avoidance require specialized knowledge that most SDRs don't have and most sales managers can't teach. Done-for-you services manage deliverability infrastructure across dozens of clients, giving them pattern recognition and technical depth that a single SDR team can't match. For a deeper look at deliverability mechanics, see our [cold email deliverability guide](/knowledge-base/deliverability-guide).

## The Hidden Costs of In-House SDRs

Beyond the line items in the cost table, in-house SDR teams carry several costs that don't show up in a budget spreadsheet.

**Turnover disruption.** The average SDR tenure is 14 months. Every departure creates a 4-6 month gap: 1-2 months to hire a replacement, 3-4 months for the new hire to ramp. During that gap, the pipeline contribution from that seat drops to near zero while the management and recruiting costs continue. A team of 3 SDRs with staggered 14-month tenures means you're perpetually in some stage of recruiting or ramping.

**Management bandwidth drain.** SDRs need daily coaching, weekly 1:1s, pipeline reviews, call coaching, and motivation management. This typically requires a dedicated SDR manager for every 6-8 reps. If your VP of Sales is managing SDRs directly (common at companies under $10M), that's 10-15 hours per week of leadership bandwidth redirected from closing deals and strategic planning.

**Opportunity cost of slow learning.** An in-house team running 50-80 touchpoints per day learns what works slowly. If your first messaging approach misses, it takes weeks to gather enough data to pivot. Done-for-you services running thousands of touchpoints per day across multiple campaigns learn in days. That speed difference compounds: by month three, a done-for-you service has tested and optimized as many variables as an in-house SDR would cover in a year.

**Infrastructure liability.** Domains get burned. Email accounts get flagged. IP addresses get blacklisted. When an in-house SDR makes a deliverability mistake — sending too high a volume from a cold domain, triggering spam filters, or hitting a spam trap — the damage lands on your infrastructure. Done-for-you services absorb this risk on their own infrastructure, protecting your primary domain and brand reputation.

<Warning>

The most expensive in-house SDR mistake isn't a bad hire — it's burning your primary domain's sender reputation through inexperienced cold email practices. One spam complaint spike can tank deliverability for your entire organization, including marketing emails and transactional messages. Always use separate sending domains for cold outbound, whether in-house or outsourced.

</Warning>

## When Does In-House Make Sense?

In-house SDRs are the right call in specific situations where control and deep product knowledge outweigh speed and cost efficiency.

<Tip>

In-house SDRs make strategic sense when: (1) your product requires 3+ months of technical training to explain competently — common in enterprise software, complex manufacturing, and regulated industries; (2) you're targeting fewer than 500 total accounts where hyper-personalized, relationship-based outreach matters more than volume; (3) you have a proven SDR playbook and experienced sales leadership to manage the team; or (4) you've reached a scale where 5+ SDRs create enough internal knowledge sharing and career pathing to reduce turnover below the 14-month average.

</Tip>

**The hybrid model.** Many companies find the optimal approach combines both: done-for-you handles top-of-funnel prospecting at scale (list building, initial outreach, qualification), while a smaller internal team handles high-value account-based outreach and complex follow-ups. This gives you the volume advantage of done-for-you with the depth advantage of in-house for your most important accounts. The internal team focuses on the 50-100 accounts that justify manual personalization, while done-for-you machinery covers the other 5,000 prospects per month.

For companies evaluating whether to build their own outbound tech stack instead, see our [DIY outbound tools vs managed service breakdown](/knowledge-base/diy-vs-managed). If you're weighing multi-channel approaches for either model, our [multi-channel vs single-channel comparison](/knowledge-base/multi-vs-single-channel) covers the performance data.

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="How much does an in-house SDR really cost per year?">
    Fully loaded — including salary, commission, benefits, payroll taxes, tools, equipment, training, management overhead, and amortized recruiting costs — a single in-house SDR costs $95,000-$166,500 per year. Most companies land at $120,000-$150,000. The commonly quoted "$75K-$120K" range typically excludes management overhead and the cost of turnover-driven recruiting cycles.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How long does it take an in-house SDR to start producing results?">
    Expect 4-6 weeks for basic onboarding, then 2-4 additional months to reach full productivity. Industry data from Predictable Revenue shows 6-12 months from scratch to see regular, consistent revenue from a new outbound team. During the ramp period, the SDR generates minimal pipeline while consuming full salary and significant management time.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can done-for-you outbound replace my entire SDR team?">
    For most B2B companies under $50M in revenue, yes — done-for-you replaces the top-of-funnel prospecting and qualification function entirely. Your account executives receive qualified meetings directly, the same handoff they'd get from internal SDRs. Companies above $50M or with hyper-technical products often benefit from a hybrid model: done-for-you for volume prospecting and a smaller internal team for strategic account-based outreach.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the biggest risk of relying on done-for-you outbound?">
    Vendor dependency — if your provider's quality drops or they lose key team members, your pipeline is affected. Mitigate this by maintaining visibility into campaign performance metrics (not just meeting counts), owning your prospect data, and keeping enough internal knowledge to evaluate quality. The best done-for-you partners provide full transparency into reply rates, deliverability metrics, and campaign copy.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I transition from in-house SDRs to done-for-you outbound?">
    Run both in parallel for 60-90 days. Launch done-for-you campaigns alongside your existing SDR team, compare meeting quality and volume side by side, then make the transition once done-for-you performance is validated. This eliminates the pipeline gap that would occur if you cut the SDR team before the new service is producing. Redeploy strong SDRs into AE or customer success roles rather than eliminating them entirely.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is done-for-you outbound too expensive for startups?">
    At $3,000-$7,500/month, done-for-you is actually less expensive than a single in-house SDR for most startups. The critical question is deal size: if your average deal is above $5,000, even 2-3 closed deals per quarter from done-for-you outbound generates positive ROI. Startups with deal sizes under $5,000 should consider email-only done-for-you services at the $1,800-$3,000/month range.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What results should I expect from done-for-you outbound in the first 90 days?">
    Month one: infrastructure setup, domain warming, initial campaigns launch, first qualified conversations (5-15 meetings). Month two: messaging optimization based on reply data, volume ramp, 10-20 qualified meetings. Month three: full campaign velocity, refined targeting, 15-30+ qualified meetings per month depending on market size and ICP. Expect the first closed deal from outbound-sourced pipeline in months 2-4, depending on your sales cycle length.

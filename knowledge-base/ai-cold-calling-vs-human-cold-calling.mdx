# AI Cold Calling vs Human Cold Calling

AI cold calling outperforms human SDRs on cost per meeting booked, speed to contact, consistency, and scalability. Human SDRs retain an advantage in complex enterprise discovery, relationship-driven industries, and conversations requiring emotional subtext interpretation. The highest-performing outbound teams run neither in isolation — they deploy AI calling as one channel inside a [multi-channel outbound system](/services/multi-channel-outbound) alongside cold email and LinkedIn, where each channel reinforces the others and compounds results. Companies running this model report 2–3x the meetings compared to any single channel operating alone.

## How AI Cold Calling Works

The term "AI cold calling" covers three fundamentally different approaches, and comparing them as one category leads to bad decisions.

**Fully autonomous AI voice agents** dial prospects, run two-way conversations in real time, handle objections, qualify leads against your criteria, and book meetings directly on your calendar — without a human on the line. The AI uses natural language processing to interpret responses and adapts based on conversation flow. Voice quality has reached the point where prospects rarely detect AI — advanced voice synthesis achieves sub-1% detection rates on standard qualification calls. Every call follows your approved script with 100% adherence. No off-script moments, no call reluctance, no energy drops at 4 PM on a Friday.

**Managed AI cold calling services** like [Outbound System](/services/ai-cold-calling) take this further by handling the entire operation: strategy, script development, agent configuration, telephony infrastructure, DNC compliance, CRM integration, ongoing optimization, and meeting booking. You approve the messaging, and qualified meetings appear on your calendar. The system makes 250–1,000+ dials per day starting five days after onboarding.

**AI-assisted human calling** keeps a human SDR on the phone but layers in real-time coaching, live script suggestions, sentiment analysis, and automated note-taking. The human drives the conversation; AI makes them better and faster.

<Info>
  AI-powered multi-channel outbound combines AI calling with AI-personalized cold email and LinkedIn outreach to create multiple touchpoints with the same prospect. Email warms the prospect and builds name recognition, LinkedIn creates visibility, and AI calling drives the live conversation that books the meeting. Clients running all three channels see 2–3x the meetings compared to cold calling alone because prospects already recognize the brand when the phone rings.

## The True Cost of a Human SDR: Line-by-Line Breakdown

The most dangerous number in this comparison is "\$60,000 salary." It's accurate and completely misleading. Salary represents 40–50% of what a human SDR actually costs. Here's every line item.

### Compensation: $75,000–$105,000/year

SDR base salaries in the US run $50,000–$70,000 depending on experience, market, and company stage. On-target earnings (base plus commissions and bonuses) add 20–60% on top, bringing total compensation to $75,000–$105,000. Median total pay sits around $93,000–$102,000 per Glassdoor data. Only about 18% of SDRs consistently hit quota — you structure compensation at OTE levels while the majority of the team underperforms those targets.

### Benefits, Payroll Taxes, and HR Overhead: $14,000–$29,000/year

| Line Item                                         | Annual Cost Range |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Health insurance (employer share)                 | $7,200–$14,400    |
| Dental, vision, life, disability                  | $1,200–$2,400     |
| 401(k) match (3–6% of salary)                     | $1,500–$4,200     |
| Employer FICA (Social Security + Medicare, 7.65%) | $3,825–$5,355     |
| State unemployment insurance (SUTA)               | $300–$2,000       |
| Workers' compensation                             | $200–$600         |
| **Subtotal**                                      | **28,955**        |

This line item alone often exceeds the entire annual cost of a managed AI cold calling service.

### Sales Tech Stack: $7,500–$18,000/year Per Seat

| Tool Category               | Common Tools                      | Annual Cost Per Seat |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| CRM                         | Salesforce, HubSpot Sales Hub     | $1,200–$3,600        |
| Sales engagement/sequencing | Outreach, Salesloft, Apollo       | $1,200–$2,400        |
| Dialer/calling platform     | Aircall, Orum, Nooks, PhoneBurner | $1,200–$3,600        |
| Contact data and enrichment | ZoomInfo, Cognism, Apollo, Lusha  | $1,200–$4,800        |
| Email deliverability tools  | Instantly, Smartlead, Warmbox     | $300–$600            |
| Conversation intelligence   | Gong, Chorus, Clari               | $1,200–$1,800        |
| LinkedIn Sales Navigator    | LinkedIn                          | \$1,200              |
| **Subtotal**                |                                   | **18,000**           |

Companies frequently undercount this because tool costs are distributed across different budget owners. Marketing owns ZoomInfo. IT manages Salesforce. RevOps pays for Gong. Consolidate per-SDR and the number shocks people.

### Management Overhead: $13,000–$25,000/year Per SDR

Standard span of control: 1 manager per 6–8 SDRs. An SDR manager's total compensation runs $90,000–$140,000. Allocated per SDR: $11,250–$23,333/year. Add the manager's own overhead and the real number sits at $13,000–$25,000 per SDR per year. AI cold calling eliminates this line entirely — there's no one to manage, coach, motivate, or hold accountable.

### Recruiting and Onboarding: $4,000–$15,000 Per Hire

Average SDR tenure: 14–18 months. You cycle through this expense repeatedly. Job board postings, recruiter screening, multiple interview rounds, and offer negotiation run $4,000–$8,000 for an internal hire. Recruiting agencies (15–20% of first-year salary) push it to $10,000–$15,000. This cost doesn't produce a single dial.

### Ramp Period: $15,000–$30,000 in Lost Productivity Per Hire

New SDRs take 3–4 months to reach full productivity. Month 1 delivers roughly 25% productivity, month 2 around 50%, month 3 approximately 75%, and month 4 approaches full output for strong performers. You pay full salary and benefits through all four months. The productivity gap costs $15,000–$30,000 per hire.

<Warning>
  Outbound System goes live in 5 days. AI doesn't ramp. It starts at 250–1,000 dials per day from week one, running scripts built from data across 10,400+ B2B campaigns. Compare that to 90–120 days before a human SDR produces at full capacity.
</Warning>

### Turnover Replacement Cycle

When an SDR quits at month 14 (average tenure), you absorb $4,000–$15,000 in recruiting costs, $15,000–$30,000 in ramp-period lost productivity, and a 2–6 week vacancy costing another $4,000–$12,000 in lost pipeline. Over three years, a single SDR seat might turn over twice, costing $38,000–$94,000 in transition expenses alone — before salary. AI systems don't quit, don't get recruited by competitors, and don't have bad months.

### Full Loaded Cost of One Producing SDR

| Component                          | Conservative  | High-End      |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Compensation (OTE)                 | \$75,000      | \$105,000     |
| Benefits and payroll taxes         | \$14,225      | \$28,955      |
| Sales tech stack (per seat)        | \$7,500       | \$18,000      |
| Management (allocated)             | \$13,000      | \$25,000      |
| Recruiting (amortized over tenure) | \$3,400       | \$10,700      |
| Ramp period (amortized)            | \$12,850      | \$25,700      |
| Workspace and equipment            | \$2,000       | \$5,000       |
| **Total Annual Loaded Cost**       | **\$127,975** | **\$218,355** |
| **Effective Monthly Cost**         | **\$10,665**  | **\$18,196**  |

A fully ramped SDR making 50–80 dials/day, connecting with 8–12 prospects, typically books 8–15 qualified meetings per month. At the midpoint (170,000 loaded cost, 12 meetings/month), each meeting costs approximately 1,180. Below-average performers (most, given 18% quota attainment) push cost per meeting to $1,400–$2,500+.

## What AI Cold Calling Actually Costs

### Model 1: DIY AI Voice Platforms

You select a platform, build your agent, write scripts, connect telephony, and manage everything yourself.

| Platform   | Advertised Rate | Billing Model                                       |
| ---------- | --------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Retell AI  | \$0.07+/min     | All-inclusive bundle                                |
| Vapi AI    | \$0.05+/min     | Modular (voice + LLM + telephony billed separately) |
| Bland AI   | \$0.09/min      | Connected call minutes                              |
| Synthflow  | \$0.08+/min     | No-code builder, plans start ~\$30/mo               |
| ElevenLabs | \$0.10+/min     | Premium voice quality                               |
| Tabbly     | \$0.08/min      | Pay-as-you-go with committed discounts              |

At 10,000 connected minutes/month, platform costs run $700–$1,500/month. Here's what the pricing page doesn't show:

| Component                    | Monthly Cost |
| ---------------------------- | ------------ |
| Platform/voice minutes       | $700–$1,500  |
| Telephony + number rotation  | $70–$300     |
| LLM costs (if separate)      | $60–$600     |
| Voice engine (if separate)   | $100–$1,200  |
| Prompt engineering (ongoing) | $600–$2,250  |
| CRM integration/middleware   | $50–$200     |
| Compliance tooling           | $100–$500    |
| Monitoring and QA            | $375–$1,500  |
| **Monthly total**            | **8,050**    |
| **Annual total**             | **96,600**   |

Plus $3,500–$16,000 in first-month setup costs. The script is 80% of performance — most DIY operators underinvest in prompt engineering and wonder why their AI agent sounds "off." DIY only makes sense if you have technical talent in-house who can manage prompt engineering, telephony infrastructure, and compliance, and you're willing to invest 60–90 days of iteration before the agent reliably books meetings.

### Model 2: Managed AI Calling Services

A provider handles everything: strategy, scripting, agent build, telephony, compliance, CRM integration, optimization, and meeting booking. Meetings show up on your calendar.

| Provider Type               | Monthly Cost      | What's Included                                                      |
| --------------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Budget managed services     | $500–$999/mo      | Basic agent, limited optimization, self-serve dashboard              |
| Mid-tier managed services   | $999–$2,500/mo    | Full-service with dedicated account management, ongoing optimization |
| Premium/enterprise services | $2,500–$5,000+/mo | Multi-campaign, custom integrations, white-glove support             |

Outbound System's pricing: 999/month for up to 250 dials/day (Starter) or 1,999/month for up to 500 dials/day (Scale). Both include AI agent, scripting, data, DNC compliance, CRM integrations, real-time dashboards, weekly optimization, and a dedicated US-based account manager. Month-to-month, no contracts. Live in 5 days. At 999–1,999/month with 20–40 meetings booked per month, cost per meeting runs **100**.

**Annual cost:** 12,000–24,000 for a fully managed operation producing comparable or better meeting volume to a single SDR costing $128,000–$218,000.

### Model 3: Traditional Outbound Agencies (Human Callers)

$4,000–$8,000/month for a dedicated or semi-dedicated human caller, usually locked into 3–6 month contracts. At those prices, your rep handles 2–4 other clients simultaneously. You're promised 150–300 dials/day but actually get 100–150. Annual cost: $48,000–$96,000 for results often comparable to or worse than a managed AI service at 1/4 to 1/8 the price.

### Cost Per Qualified Meeting Comparison

| Channel                                 | Annual Cost | Meetings/Month | Cost Per Meeting | Days to First Meeting |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------- | -------------- | ---------------- | --------------------- |
| In-house SDR (fully loaded)             | $128K–$218K | 8–15           | $711–$1,389      | 90–120 (hire + ramp)  |
| Outbound agency (human)                 | $48K–$96K   | 5–15           | $267–$1,600      | 14–30                 |
| Managed AI service                      | $12K–$24K   | 20–40          | $25–$100         | 5                     |
| DIY AI platform                         | $25K–$97K   | 10–30          | $69–$808         | 30–90                 |
| **Multi-channel AI + email + LinkedIn** | **48K**     | **30–60**      | **133**          | **5–7**               |

The multi-channel row is where the math gets compelling. Running AI calling alongside [cold email](/services/cold-email) and [LinkedIn outreach](/services/linkedin-outreach) from a single platform means each channel lifts the others — email warms the prospect before the call, LinkedIn builds familiarity, and the AI call converts accumulated touchpoints into a live conversation.

## Performance Head-to-Head: Seven Dimensions

### 1. Speed and Scale

A single AI agent handles hundreds of simultaneous calls. Outbound System's Starter plan delivers 250 dials/day; Scale delivers 500+. That's more daily outreach than an entire SDR team produces in a week. A human SDR working an 8-hour shift with a power dialer covers 50–80 dials on a productive day. Subtract breaks, CRM updates, research time, and call reluctance, and effective dial count often lands at 40–60.

**Winner: AI, by 5–20x.**

### 2. Consistency and Script Adherence

Every AI call follows your approved messaging with perfect consistency. Tone doesn't shift after a bad conversation. Energy doesn't fade after 200 dials. The gap between a top-decile human SDR and a median human SDR is enormous — often 3–4x in meetings booked per month. A team of 5 SDRs might have one star, two average performers, and two who barely justify their seats.

**Winner: AI.** The floor is dramatically higher, even if the ceiling for an elite human SDR exceeds AI on complex calls.

### 3. Personalization Depth

Modern AI cold callers personalize each call with context: industry, role, company size, recent activity signals, and specific pain points. Each conversation includes context that would take a human SDR 5–10 minutes of pre-call research. Human SDRs theoretically can personalize more deeply — referencing a prospect's LinkedIn post or recent earnings call. In practice, the top 10% research thoroughly. The other 90% default to generic openers when trying to hit 60+ dials/day.

**Winner: AI for consistent personalization at scale. Humans for deep, context-rich personalization on high-value targets** (when they actually do the research).

### 4. Objection Handling

Well-built AI agents handle standard B2B objections effectively: "I'm not interested," "send me an email," "we already have a solution," "I don't have budget," "this isn't a good time." When a prospect raises a genuinely novel concern — an obscure regulatory requirement, an internal political dynamic, a technical objection requiring deep product knowledge — AI agents either loop back to scripted paths or produce slightly off responses.

**Winner: AI for standard objections (80%+ of cold call objections). Humans for the 15–20% requiring genuine domain improvisation.**

### 5. Qualification Accuracy and Data Capture

AI agents follow qualification criteria with zero deviation. If your framework requires BANT or MEDDIC questions, the agent asks every question, every time, and logs structured data to your CRM automatically. Human SDRs frequently skip qualification steps, avoid asking about budget, and pass leads as "interested" based on vibes rather than confirmed criteria.

**Winner: AI for rigorous, consistent qualification. Humans for nuanced judgment** (recognizing that "no budget" sometimes means "not this quarter").

### 6. Trust and Relationship Building

This is where the human advantage remains clearest, particularly in high-ACV enterprise sales. A $200,000 deal with an 8-month sales cycle closes because an SDR multi-threaded into stakeholders and built enough rapport to earn second meetings. For SMB and mid-market transactions under $50K ACV with shorter cycles, AI-booked meetings convert at comparable rates.

**Winner: Humans for enterprise (\$100K+ ACV, 6+ month cycles). AI for SMB/mid-market where the meeting itself is the main conversion event.**

### 7. Learning Velocity and Optimization Speed

Human SDRs improve through coaching and experience over months. A good manager might review 5–10 calls per week per rep. AI systems generate complete data on every conversation: which opening lines produce the longest engagement, which objection responses lead to continued interest, which ICP segments convert highest, what time of day produces the best connection rates. This enables weekly optimization cycles. By month 3, the system has been optimized through thousands of data points — operating at a performance level a newly-ramped SDR cannot match.

**Winner: AI, decisively.**

## When Human SDRs Still Win

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Complex Enterprise Discovery">
    When your ICP is VP+ at Fortune 2000 companies, initial outreach needs strategic fluency and genuine business insight. For deals above \$100K ACV with buying committees of 5+ stakeholders, the human SDR's ability to multi-thread, build internal champions, and navigate political dynamics is irreplaceable.

    **Hybrid solution:** Use AI calling or multi-channel outbound to identify and warm enterprise accounts. When AI identifies interest signals — email engagement, site visits, positive qualification responses — hand the account to a human SDR for high-touch follow-up. AI handles volume; humans handle value.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Relationship-Dependent Industries">
    Financial advisory, executive recruiting, management consulting, high-end professional services — sectors where the sales process IS the relationship. The SDR's personality, credibility, and ability to have a genuinely unscripted conversation directly influences engagement.

    **Hybrid solution:** AI calling excels at re-engaging dormant leads, qualifying inbound inquiries, and scheduling follow-ups. Human relationship builders focus on conversations demanding emotional intelligence.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Regulatory-Sensitive Outreach">
    The FCC classified AI-generated voices as "artificial" under the TCPA, meaning prior express consent is required for automated AI calls to mobile phones. B2B calling to business lines has more regulatory flexibility, but industries like healthcare and certain financial products have additional compliance layers.

    **Managed solution:** Compliance infrastructure matters more than platform selection. Outbound System includes DNC + TCPA list scrubbing, time-zone enforcement, clear caller identification, and opt-out handling as standard in every plan.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## The Multi-Channel Hybrid Model

The highest-performing outbound teams aren't choosing AI or human calling. They're running cold email, AI calling, and LinkedIn simultaneously against the same prospect list, creating a compounding effect that outperforms any single channel.

The math: cold email alone produces 1–3% reply rates. AI cold calling alone achieves 5–15% connection rates on answered calls. LinkedIn alone delivers 15–30% acceptance rates with 5–15% reply rates. All three together mean the prospect sees your email on Monday, your LinkedIn connection request on Tuesday, and answers your call on Wednesday already knowing who you are. Connection rates increase because you're a recognized name, not a cold interruption.

### Practical Multi-Channel Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Days 1–2: Email + LinkedIn">
    Cold email lands with personalized messaging specific to the prospect's industry and role. LinkedIn connection request goes out with a brief, non-salesy note. Purpose: establish name recognition and plant the "who is this company?" seed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Days 3–5: AI Calling">
    AI agent calls prospects who opened emails, accepted LinkedIn requests, or match high-priority ICP criteria. The call references prior touchpoints naturally: "I sent over some information about [specific pain point] earlier this week — wanted to see if it resonated." Purpose: convert accumulated familiarity into a live conversation and booked meeting.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Days 6–10: Follow-Up Sequence">
    Non-responders get a follow-up email with a different angle. AI calling re-engages prospects who connected but didn't book. LinkedIn messaging continues for those who accepted but haven't responded. Purpose: catch prospects who were interested but busy.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Week 2+: Ongoing Optimization">
    Analyze which channels, messages, and segments produce meetings. Shift resources toward what's working. A/B test opening lines, email subject lines, and calling times. Scale winning combinations; kill underperformers. This is where compounding performance begins — by month 3, the system operates at levels static campaigns never reach.
  </Step>
</Steps>

This operational model drives the results behind 72,000+ meetings booked across the Outbound System client base, \$26M in closed revenue, and 11M+ dials. The volume and consistency are only possible because the system runs continuously across all three channels with AI handling the heavy lifting.

## Decision Framework: Which Model Fits Your Business

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="AI as Primary Channel">
    Use AI cold calling as your primary outbound channel when your average deal size is under $50K ACV, you have 1,000+ potential accounts, qualification criteria are structured and repeatable, sales cycles run under 6 months, your ICP responds to phone outreach (contractors, practice owners, operational leaders, SMB decision-makers), you're spending $4K+/month on human SDRs or agencies for initial outreach, and you need meetings within 5–14 days rather than 90–120.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Multi-Channel AI System">
    Use AI calling as part of a multi-channel system when you target mid-market accounts ($25K–$100K ACV), your ICP uses email, phone, and LinkedIn, you want maximum coverage of your TAM, you've tested single-channel and want to 2–3x meeting volume, and you want compounding optimization from cross-channel data. This is where managed multi-channel providers like [Outbound System](/services/multi-channel-outbound) deliver the most value.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Keep Human SDRs">
    Keep human SDRs when you sell into enterprise accounts (\$100K+ ACV, 6+ month cycles), your total addressable market is under 500 accounts, your product requires deep technical discovery before a demo, your industry requires relationship-driven selling, or you haven't validated your ICP and messaging through human conversations yet. AI amplifies what works — it doesn't figure out what works.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Hybrid Stack (Most B2B Companies)">
    For most mid-market B2B companies: 1 human SDR paired with a managed AI calling system produces more pipeline than 3–4 human SDRs operating independently. AI covers 5–10x more of your TAM while the human focuses exclusively on conversations that generate the most revenue per hour of their time. AI handles initial qualification, lead re-engagement, meeting booking, and follow-up sequences. Humans handle named-account outreach, complex discovery, multi-threading into buying committees, and relationship nurture.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Implementation Playbook

<Steps>
  <Step title="Foundation: Define Your ICP and Qualification Criteria">
    AI cold calling amplifies whatever list you feed it. A great list produces meetings; a bad list produces wasted dials. Specify industry, company size, revenue range, titles, geographic focus, and signal-based criteria (recently funded, hiring for specific roles, using competitor products). Define 3–5 qualification questions your AI agent must ask and the answers that constitute a qualified lead. Write your value proposition in one sentence — your AI agent's opening line is everything.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Launch: Days 1–5 with a Managed Service">
    Days 1–2: Strategy call to build target buyer profile, messaging angles, objection handling, qualification criteria, and cold call script. You approve everything before a single dial. Days 3–4: Agent setup, system configuration, data sourcing, DNC scrubbing, CRM integration, and extensive testing. Day 5: Calls begin. Meetings appear on your calendar. Real-time dashboard active from day one. DIY builders should budget 30–60 days for initial setup, testing, and iteration.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Optimize: Weeks 2–12">
    Week 2: Review first-week data — which opening lines produced the longest conversations, which ICP segments had highest connection rates, which objection responses led to continued engagement. Weeks 3–4: A/B test opening approaches, call times, and voicemail strategies. Months 2–3: The compounding phase — hundreds or thousands of conversations reveal patterns invisible in week 1, such as certain industries responding better at specific times or certain titles responding better to ROI framing versus pain-point framing.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Scale: Month 3+">
    Once you've identified winning scripts, ICP segments, and channel combinations, scaling is mechanical. Increase daily dial volume, add new ICP segments using the same proven framework, layer in additional channels if not already running, and run multiple simultaneous campaigns targeting different buyer personas. The infrastructure, scripts, and targeting logic carry forward.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can prospects tell they're talking to AI?">
    Detection rates have dropped below 1% in controlled settings with advanced voice synthesis. Prospects engage because the conversation feels authentic, relevant, and professional. Detection rates increase when conversations go significantly off-script or require deep domain improvisation — but for standard qualification calls, most prospects don't question it.

  <Accordion title="Is AI cold calling legal?">
    AI-assisted outreach is legal but regulated. The FCC's ruling classified AI-generated voices as "artificial" under the TCPA, meaning prior express consent is required for automated AI calls to cell phones. B2B calling to business lines has more flexibility. DNC registry scrubbing, time-zone restrictions, caller identification, and opt-out handling are non-negotiable. Managed services like Outbound System build compliance into infrastructure — DNC + TCPA scrubbing, time-zone enforcement, disclosure at call opening, and immediate opt-out honoring.

  <Accordion title="How many meetings can AI cold calling produce?">
    Results vary by industry, ICP accessibility, offer strength, and list quality. Published case studies show ranges of 15–35 meetings per month for most clients, with outliers significantly higher — 330 meetings over 12 months for one client, 122 meetings over 10 months for another. At 250–1,000 dials per day, even conservative connection and conversion rates produce meaningful meeting volume.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Should I replace my entire SDR team with AI?">
    For most companies, no — especially if your SDRs handle enterprise accounts above \$75K ACV. The optimal model is hybrid: AI handles the volume layer (initial qualification, lead re-engagement, follow-up) while human SDRs handle the value layer (named account outreach, complex discovery, relationship building). The ratio that works for most mid-market companies: 1 human SDR + 1 managed AI system produces more pipeline than 3–4 SDRs alone.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What's the ROI timeline for AI cold calling?">
    Managed AI services typically produce meetings within the first week. Outbound System is live in 5 days. Positive ROI for most clients occurs within 30–60 days depending on deal cycle. Compare to hiring an SDR: 3–4 months before full productivity, 6+ months before the hire breaks even on recruiting and ramp costs. DIY AI platforms take 30–90 days to reach consistent performance because you absorb the learning curve on prompt engineering, telephony, and optimization.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What industries work best for AI cold calling?">
    AI calling performs strongest with phone-responsive audiences: local service businesses, contractors, healthcare practice owners, food service directors, real estate, manufacturing, and operational decision-makers at mid-market companies. It also works for SaaS companies targeting VP and director-level buyers across a broad addressable market. Published case studies span [private equity](/industries/private-equity), SaaS, marketing agencies, manufacturing, professional services, and financial services.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How does AI cold calling compare to cold email?">
    Different channels, different strengths. Cold email scales infinitely at low cost but has low engagement rates (1–3% reply). AI calling has higher engagement per touch (5–15% connection rate) but requires more infrastructure. The highest-performing outbound operations use both: [email builds name recognition](/services/cold-email), calling converts it to meetings. Combined channels produce 2–3x meeting volume compared to either channel alone.

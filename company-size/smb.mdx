# SMB Lead Generation — Done-For-You Outbound for Small & Medium Businesses

SMBs need pipeline now — not in 6 months after hiring an SDR, buying 5 tools, and running experiments. Outbound System launches done-for-you campaigns in 14 days using industry-tested playbooks from 44+ engagements, with every tool and infrastructure component included. Clients include Convert (315K pipeline, 5,733% ROI, 70% close rate), Contractors Creative (120K, 10 new clients), and Modern CPA (\$90K in pipeline that forced them to hire another sales rep to handle the volume).

## Who Is SMB Outbound For?

This program is built for companies with 10–200 employees, deal sizes between $5K and $100K, and an urgent need for predictable pipeline without an internal lead generation team. You have a product or service that sells. You have salespeople who can close. What you do not have is a reliable way to fill their calendar with qualified meetings — and you cannot afford to spend 6–12 months building that capability internally while revenue stalls.

## Why SMB Outbound Is Different from Enterprise and Startup

SMB outbound operates under a different set of constraints than enterprise or startup outbound, and those constraints dictate the approach.

**Speed matters more than precision.** Enterprise deals justify 4–6 weeks of account research per target because a single close is worth 250K+. At 10K–\$50K deal sizes, you need volume and velocity. The math requires 15–25 qualified meetings per month, not 5 deeply researched ones.

**No time to build internal expertise.** Figuring out cold email deliverability, inbox warm-up schedules, reply handling, and list building takes most teams 6–12 months of trial and error. That is 6–12 months without predictable pipeline. Industry-tested playbooks from 44+ engagements compress that learning curve to zero.

**Tool stack costs add up fast.** Building a DIY outbound stack — sending platform, warm-up tool, email verification, lead database, tracking, CRM — runs $1,300–$2,300 per month in software alone, before you spend a single hour operating it. That is $15,600–$27,600 per year just for tools, with no guarantee the configuration is correct.

**Revenue is urgent.** Startups can sometimes justify a 60–90 day ICP validation period. Enterprise companies can absorb a 6-month sales cycle. SMBs operating on cash flow need meetings this month, not a data report next quarter.

## SMB-Specific Pains We Solve

**No internal lead gen expertise.** Most SMBs have salespeople, not outbound specialists. The difference matters — outbound requires deliverability management, list segmentation, A/B message testing, domain infrastructure, and reply handling that sales reps are not trained to do and should not be spending time on.

**Building the right tech stack takes time and money.** Choosing between 30+ sending platforms, 10+ warm-up tools, and 15+ data providers — then configuring them to work together — is a 2–3 month project. Most SMBs get it wrong the first time, burn a domain, and start over.

**It takes years to figure out what works.** Which subject lines get opens? Which CTAs get replies? Which personas convert? Which industries respond? Outbound System has run 44+ engagements across dozens of industries and has tested thousands of message variations. That data is applied to your campaign from day one.

**Revenue cannot wait.** Every month without predictable pipeline is a month of unpredictable growth. SMBs that depend on referrals, inbound, or the founder's personal network hit a ceiling that only systematic outbound breaks through.

<Info>
  The average SMB spends $1,300–$2,300 per month on outbound tools alone — warm-up, sending, verification, data, tracking, and CRM. With Outbound System, every tool is included in the service fee. No separate subscriptions, no configuration headaches, no surprise costs.

## Our SMB Approach

<Steps>
  <Step title="Assign a Full Outbound Team Instantly">
    You get a dedicated researcher, copywriter, SDR, and account manager from day one. No hiring, no training, no ramp time. The team has run outbound across 44+ engagements and applies proven processes immediately — there is no 90-day learning curve.
  </Step>
  <Step title="All Tools and Infrastructure Included">
    Sending platform, warm-up tool, email verification, lead database, tracking, reply management, and CRM integration — all included. Azure infrastructure with dedicated IPs, domain protection, and deliverability monitoring. You do not buy or manage a single outbound tool.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Industry-Tested Playbooks from 44+ Engagements">
    We do not experiment on your budget. Your campaign launches with messaging frameworks, targeting criteria, and sequence structures that have been tested across dozens of industries and hundreds of thousands of sent emails. What works gets applied; what does not gets skipped.
  </Step>
  <Step title="You Focus on Closing — We Handle Everything Upstream">
    List building, email copywriting, A/B testing, deliverability management, response handling, and meeting scheduling are all handled by your dedicated team. Qualified meetings land on your calendar. Your salespeople do what they do best — close.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Infrastructure Protection Built In">
    Azure setup, inbox warm-up, domain reputation monitoring, and sending throttling protect your brand from deliverability damage. Your primary domain is never at risk — all outbound runs on dedicated sending domains with proper DNS authentication (SPF, DKIM, DMARC). See our [deliverability guide](/knowledge-base/deliverability-guide) for the technical details.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Timeline: From Kickoff to Meetings

Campaign launch follows a 14-day onboarding process. First qualified meetings typically arrive within 30 days of go-live. By day 45, you have enough response data to confirm targeting accuracy and messaging resonance. By day 60, campaigns are optimized and running at steady-state volume.

<Tip>
  Every tool is included in the Outbound System service fee — sending infrastructure, warm-up, verification, data, tracking, and CRM integration. No separate subscriptions. No configuration. No surprise invoices from 6 different SaaS vendors.

## What the Pipeline Looks Like

SMB campaigns are built for volume and velocity. Here is the typical output:

| Metric                    | Monthly Output                              |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Qualified Meetings Booked | 15–25                                       |
| Scalability               | Volume adjustable up or down month-to-month |
| Time to First Meeting     | Within 30 days of launch                    |
| Contract Structure        | Month-to-month, no long-term commitment     |

Pipeline scales with campaign volume. Clients who need 40+ meetings per month can run multiple parallel campaigns targeting different personas, industries, or geographies.

## Cost Comparison: DIY vs. In-House SDR vs. Outbound System

| Cost Factor                  | DIY Tool Stack                   | In-House SDR                 | Outbound System                 |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Monthly Tool Cost**        | $1,300–$2,300/month              | $1,300–$2,300/month          | Included                        |
| **Annual Tool Cost**         | $15,600–$27,600                  | $15,600–$27,600              | Included                        |
| **Personnel Cost**           | Your time (or a hire)            | $75K–$120K/year fully loaded | Included (full team)            |
| **Ramp Time**                | 3–6 months to learn              | 3–4 months to hire + train   | 14 days to campaign launch      |
| **Time to First Meeting**    | 60–90 days (if setup is correct) | 90–120 days (after hiring)   | 30 days                         |
| **Deliverability Expertise** | You figure it out                | Rarely on staff              | Dedicated team, included        |
| **Infrastructure**           | You build and maintain           | You build and maintain       | Enterprise Azure, fully managed |
| **Contract**                 | Annual SaaS contracts            | Employment commitment        | Month-to-month                  |

<Warning>
  The most common SMB outbound mistake is underestimating infrastructure complexity. Buying a sending tool and a lead list is 20% of the work. The other 80% — warm-up scheduling, domain authentication, sending throttling, reply routing, bounce management, and deliverability monitoring — is where campaigns succeed or fail. Skipping this produces open rates below 15% and reply rates below 0.5%.
</Warning>

## Proof: SMB Results

These results come from SMB engagements with deal sizes between $5K and $100K and teams of 10–200 employees.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card href="/case-studies/convert" title="Convert — $315K, 5,733% ROI">
    70% close rate on meetings generated. Outbound System produced a pipeline so qualified that the majority of meetings converted to paying clients — a close rate nearly 4x the B2B average.
  </Card>
  <Card href="/case-studies/modern-cpa" title="Modern CPA — $90K, Had to Hire Another Sales Rep">
    30 qualified meetings generated. Pipeline volume was high enough that the existing sales team could not handle the load, forcing an additional hire — a sign that outbound was producing well beyond capacity.
  </Card>
  <Card href="/case-studies/contractors-creative" title="Contractors Creative — $120K, 10 New Clients">
    37% reply rate across campaigns. Industry-specific messaging for the construction vertical produced response rates more than 10x the cold email industry average of 1–3%.
  </Card>
  <Card href="/case-studies/velox-media" title="Velox Media — $180K, 60 Meetings">
    Outperformed the internal team. Outbound System generated more meetings at lower cost than Velox Media's existing in-house SDR operation, demonstrating the leverage of tested playbooks over internal trial-and-error.
  </Card>
  <Card href="/case-studies/brandetize" title="Brandetize — $77K, 7 Clients">
    69 responses per month sustained over the engagement. High response volume gave the sales team consistent daily pipeline activity rather than the feast-or-famine pattern typical of referral-dependent SMBs.
  </Card>
  <Card href="/case-studies/value-buddy" title="Value Buddy — $126K, 70 Meetings, 12 Deals">
    12 closed deals from outbound-generated meetings. A 17% meeting-to-deal conversion rate demonstrates the quality of targeting — not just volume, but qualified volume.
  </Card>
  <Card href="/case-studies/al-air" title="Al-Air — $54K, 3 Property Contracts, 1,400% ROI">
    3 property contracts secured through cold outbound in a vertical where most lead generation is referral-based. Proof that outbound works in traditionally relationship-driven industries.
  </Card>
  <Card href="/case-studies/echo-marketing" title="Echo Marketing — $48K, 26 Meetings">
    Rebuilt pipeline confidence after a failed agency engagement. 26 qualified meetings demonstrated that the previous agency's failure was a methodology problem, not a market problem.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How fast can we start getting meetings?">
    Campaigns go live 14 days after kickoff. First qualified meetings typically arrive within 30 days of launch. The 14-day onboarding includes ICP definition, list building, message creation, infrastructure setup, and domain warm-up — all handled by your dedicated team. You are not waiting months while someone learns your business.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What tools are included — do we need to buy anything separately?">
    Everything is included: sending platform, inbox warm-up, email verification, lead database access, tracking and analytics, reply management, and CRM integration. Azure infrastructure with dedicated IPs and domain protection is also included. You do not purchase, configure, or maintain a single outbound tool. The $1,300–$2,300 per month that a DIY stack would cost is built into the service fee.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How many meetings per month should we expect?">
    SMB campaigns typically produce 15–25 qualified meetings per month at steady state. Volume depends on your ICP size, deal value, and industry. Clients who need more can run parallel campaigns targeting additional personas, verticals, or geographies. Convert ran campaigns that generated enough pipeline for a 70% close rate; Modern CPA generated enough meetings to require hiring another sales rep.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What if we have tried outbound before and it did not work?">
    Most failed outbound attempts fail for one of three reasons: poor deliverability infrastructure (emails landing in spam), untested messaging (generic templates with no industry relevance), or wrong targeting (reaching people who are not in a buying window). Outbound System addresses all three: enterprise-grade infrastructure, industry-tested playbooks from 44+ engagements, and intent-based targeting. Echo Marketing came to us after a failed agency experience and generated \$48K from 26 qualified meetings.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Is there a long-term contract?">
    No. Outbound System operates month-to-month with no long-term commitment. Most clients stay because the pipeline is working, not because a contract forces them to. If meetings stop being valuable, you stop — but across 44+ engagements, the average ROI is 1,400%, so clients tend to scale up rather than cancel.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How does this compare to hiring an in-house SDR?">
    A fully loaded in-house SDR costs $75K–$120K per year in salary and benefits, plus $1,300–$2,300 per month in tools, plus 3–4 months of ramp time before they produce pipeline. Outbound System includes a full team (researcher, copywriter, SDR, account manager), all tools, and enterprise infrastructure — with first meetings arriving in 30 days instead of 120+. For SMBs that cannot afford a 4-month gap in pipeline, the math favors done-for-you. See our [full comparison of outsourced vs. in-house outbound](/knowledge-base/outsourced-vs-in-house).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Will outbound damage our brand or domain reputation?">
    Not with proper infrastructure. All outbound runs on dedicated sending domains — your primary domain is never used for cold outreach. Each sending domain is authenticated with SPF, DKIM, and DMARC. Inboxes are warmed gradually over 14–21 days before any campaign volume. Sending throttling prevents volume spikes that trigger spam filters. Deliverability is monitored daily, and any domain showing reputation decline is rotated immediately. See our [deliverability guide](/knowledge-base/deliverability-guide) for the full technical breakdown.

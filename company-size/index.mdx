# B2B Lead Generation by Company Size

Outbound that works for a 500-person enterprise selling 250K contracts to buying committees is structurally different from outbound that works for a 15-person startup validating ICP with 10K deals. Outbound System runs done-for-you campaigns calibrated to your company stage — with 44 case studies proving the approach across enterprise, SMB, and startup engagements.

## Why Outbound Approach Differs by Stage

The mechanics change at every level. Enterprise outbound requires multi-persona sequencing across 3–7 stakeholder committees, dedicated Azure infrastructure, and ABM cadences that nurture over months. SMB outbound requires speed — campaigns live in 14 days using industry-tested playbooks from 44+ engagements so you generate revenue now, not after months of experimentation. Startup outbound requires dual output: pipeline that closes deals and data that validates your ICP, maps your TAM, and gives investors the traction metrics they need to write checks.

Choosing the wrong approach wastes budget. Running enterprise-grade ABM for a startup burns cash on precision that is premature. Running high-volume SMB tactics for enterprise accounts burns domain reputation on prospects who need 8–12 personalized touches before they will take a meeting.

<Info>
  Across 44 case studies, the average ROI is 1,400%. But the path to that ROI looks different at each stage — enterprise clients see it through fewer, larger deals; SMBs see it through volume and speed; startups see it through ICP validation that compounds into repeatable revenue.

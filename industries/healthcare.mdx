# Lead Generation for Healthcare & HealthTech Companies

Healthcare outbound fails more often than any other vertical — not because of messaging, but because of infrastructure. Hospital and health system email environments run the most aggressive spam filtering in B2B, blocking standard sending infrastructure before a human ever sees the message. Enterprise Azure infrastructure with U.S. IP addresses and Microsoft domain reputation is required — not preferred — for healthcare inbox placement. Portiva proved the model works: $168K in revenue from 56 meetings over 9 months, maintaining 31 responses/month with infrastructure specifically configured for healthcare deliverability.

## Why Healthcare Outbound Requires Specialized Infrastructure

Healthcare email environments are fundamentally different from every other B2B vertical. Three factors make standard outbound infrastructure unusable:

**Hospital IT systems run enterprise-grade spam filtering.** Health systems use Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace with enhanced security policies that block emails from shared IPs, unrecognized domains, and non-Microsoft infrastructure. Standard outbound tools (shared sending IPs, basic domain warm-up) trigger these filters consistently. Portiva's campaign required enterprise Azure setup with dedicated U.S. IPs and Microsoft-native domain reputation to achieve consistent inbox placement across health system email environments.

**Compliance sensitivity constrains messaging.** Healthcare outreach can't request Protected Health Information (PHI), make clinical outcome claims, or use pressure language that implies patient safety urgency. The copy framework must educate and demonstrate ROI through operational metrics — cost savings, efficiency gains, workflow improvements — not clinical promises.

**Procurement involves committees, not individuals.** A hospital CTO doesn't approve a new platform alone. Clinical directors, compliance officers, IT security, and procurement all weigh in. Multi-stakeholder sequences that address each persona's specific concerns — technical feasibility for IT, workflow impact for clinical, compliance alignment for legal — produce meetings that actually advance through the buying process.

<Warning>

**Compliance is non-negotiable in healthcare outreach.** Never request PHI, make clinical outcome promises, or imply patient safety urgency in cold outreach. Every message should focus on operational outcomes (cost, efficiency, workflow) rather than clinical claims. Have your compliance team review messaging frameworks before deployment if your organization has specific HIPAA or regulatory requirements.

</Warning>

## How We Target Healthcare Buyers

| Targeting Criteria | Details |
|---|---|
| **Primary Titles** | Health system CTOs, CIOs, clinical directors, practice administrators, VP Operations |
| **Organization Size** | Health systems with 200+ beds or practice groups with 5+ locations |
| **Signal Filters** | EHR system migrations, new CTO/CIO appointments, regulatory changes requiring new technology, healthcare system RFP announcements |
| **Infrastructure** | Azure U.S. IP addresses, Microsoft domain reputation, conservative send volumes, MX-based routing optimized for healthcare email servers |
| **Send Volume** | Conservative — 50-75% of standard B2B send volumes to protect domain reputation against healthcare filters |
| **Exclusions** | Individual practitioners, clinics under 5 providers, organizations with active RFP processes (use different channel) |

<Info>

**Why Azure U.S. infrastructure is critical for healthcare:** Healthcare organizations overwhelmingly use Microsoft 365 for email. Microsoft-to-Microsoft email delivery benefits from inherent trust signals that non-Microsoft infrastructure doesn't receive. Azure U.S. IP addresses combined with Microsoft-native domain reputation produce 2-3x the inbox placement rate of standard infrastructure when targeting healthcare email environments.

## Our Healthcare Outbound Approach

<Steps>

  <Step title="Infrastructure Configuration for Healthcare">

    Before any message sends, the infrastructure is specifically configured for healthcare deliverability: dedicated Azure U.S. IP addresses, Microsoft-native domain reputation building, MX-based routing optimized for healthcare email servers, and conservative send volumes (50-75% of standard B2B). This setup takes 2-3 weeks but is the foundation that makes everything else work.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Compliance-Sensitive Copy Development">

    Every messaging framework is built within healthcare communication guardrails. No PHI requests, no clinical outcome claims, no pressure language. Messages lead with operational ROI — Portiva's campaign focused on virtual medical assistant cost savings versus in-house staffing, using specific dollar figures that practice administrators could validate against their own budgets.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Multi-Stakeholder Sequencing">

    Healthcare buying involves 3-5 stakeholders. The campaign targets multiple personas at the same organization: operational messaging for administrators, technical messaging for IT leadership, and workflow-impact messaging for clinical directors. When one stakeholder engages, parallel sequences to other decision-makers reference that internal interest to build momentum.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Extended Timeline Execution">

    Healthcare sales cycles run 6-12 months. Campaigns are designed for sustained execution — Portiva ran 9 months, maintaining 31 responses/month throughout. The cadence is deliberately patient: 10-14 day email spacing, quarterly re-engagement of warm prospects, and ongoing list refresh as new trigger events surface.

  </Step>

</Steps>

<Tip>

**Healthcare trigger events worth monitoring:** EHR system migrations (organizations evaluating entire tech stack), new CTO or CIO appointments (technology vendor review underway), regulatory changes requiring new capabilities (compliance pressure creates budget), and active administrative hiring (scaling operations signals capacity for new solutions).

</Tip>

## Recommended Copy Frameworks

**Signal-Based Opener** works best when trigger events are visible: "Your health system's EHR migration suggests you're evaluating operational workflows — three health systems in a similar transition reduced admin costs by 34% by addressing [specific workflow] during the switchover." The framework demonstrates market awareness without making clinical claims.

**Social Proof Lead with Healthcare Proof** adapts the standard social proof framework for compliance sensitivity. Results reference operational metrics (cost reduction, time savings, workflow efficiency) from healthcare-specific case studies, not clinical outcomes. Anonymized proof works well in healthcare because organizations are cautious about being publicly named.

## What Makes Healthcare Outbound Fail

**Using standard infrastructure.** This is the single most common and most expensive healthcare outbound mistake. Standard shared IPs, non-Microsoft domains, and basic warm-up sequences are blocked by healthcare email filters before a human sees the message. Every dollar spent on copy, targeting, and sequencing is wasted if the infrastructure doesn't deliver to healthcare inboxes. Azure U.S. enterprise infrastructure is the minimum viable starting point.

**Clinical outcome claims in cold outreach.** Messaging that implies clinical improvements, patient outcome guarantees, or safety enhancements triggers both spam filters (healthcare IT flags these patterns) and human skepticism (healthcare leaders dismiss unverified clinical claims from unknown vendors). Operational ROI — cost reduction, workflow efficiency, admin time savings — is the only credible angle for cold outreach.

**Expecting SaaS-speed results.** Healthcare procurement takes 6-12 months. Campaigns that run for 3 months and are evaluated on closed revenue will always look like failures. Portiva's 9-month campaign generated pipeline steadily — $168K in recognized revenue with additional deals still progressing in the pipeline at campaign end. Healthcare outbound is a sustained investment, not a quick-hit channel.

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="How long does it take to see meetings from healthcare outbound?">
    Initial meetings typically appear in weeks 3-6 after infrastructure warm-up is complete. The infrastructure configuration itself takes 2-3 weeks. Portiva generated 56 meetings over 9 months with steady volume each month, meaning pipeline was flowing by month 2. However, the revenue impact takes longer — healthcare deals close in 6-12 months, so recognize revenue on a 9-12 month horizon, not a quarterly one.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do you handle HIPAA compliance in the outreach?">
    Our messaging frameworks are built to avoid HIPAA-sensitive territory: no PHI requests, no clinical claims, and no language that could be interpreted as healthcare advice. That said, we're an outbound provider, not a compliance attorney. Organizations with specific regulatory requirements should have their compliance team review messaging before deployment. We provide the framework; your team validates the compliance alignment.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can outbound work for medical devices and health tech, not just services?">
    Yes — the infrastructure and targeting methodology applies across healthcare categories. Medical device companies, HealthTech platforms, and health services all face the same deliverability challenge (healthcare spam filtering) and the same buying dynamic (committee-based procurement). The messaging framework adjusts — device companies lead with clinical workflow integration, platforms lead with operational efficiency, services lead with cost comparison — but the infrastructure foundation is identical.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why is Azure infrastructure specifically required for healthcare?">
    Healthcare organizations overwhelmingly use Microsoft 365. Microsoft-to-Microsoft email delivery receives inherent trust signals: domain reputation within the Microsoft ecosystem, IP reputation verified through Azure infrastructure, and authentication chain verification. Non-Microsoft sending infrastructure — including popular outbound tools built on Google or custom SMTP — lacks these trust signals and is filtered more aggressively. The result is 2-3x the inbox placement rate from Azure versus standard infrastructure. See the [deliverability guide](/knowledge-base/deliverability-guide) for technical specifications.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What meeting volume should healthcare companies expect?">
    Healthcare campaigns typically produce 5-10 qualified meetings per month at steady state, which is lower than SaaS or agency verticals but reflects the higher deal values and longer buying cycles. Portiva averaged 6 meetings/month over 9 months. The meetings that do occur tend to involve senior stakeholders with real purchasing authority — quality over quantity is the healthcare outbound model.

Every industry below gets a custom playbook — targeting logic built around how that industry's buyers actually evaluate vendors, messaging frameworks drawn from real campaign data, and infrastructure configured for that vertical's specific deliverability challenges. Across 44 campaigns and 14 industries, industry-tuned outbound averages 4-8% positive reply rates where generic approaches average 1-2%.

<Info>

**Generic outbound: 1-2% reply rate. Industry-tuned outbound: 4-8% reply rate.** The difference is targeting precision, vertical-specific messaging, and infrastructure configured for each industry's email environment. Every industry below has a dedicated playbook built from real campaign results across 14 verticals.

## Why Industry-Specific Outbound Matters

The gap between generic and industry-tuned outbound isn't incremental — it's 3-4x. Three factors drive the difference:

**Targeting precision.** Generic lists scrape by industry code. Industry-tuned lists use vertical-specific signals: funding triggers for SaaS (Alo Media's 60-90 day post-funding window), active job postings for staffing (3rd Degree Screening's 10+ open roles signal), event calendars for experiential (Manifaith's 60-90 day planning window). Signal-based targeting produces 3-5x the response rate of demographic-only lists.

**Messaging that speaks the buyer's language.** Amazon sellers evaluate ACOS and buy box win rates — not "digital marketing ROI" (Evolved Commerce). CPA firm partners care about billable hours and client retention — not "business growth" (Modern CPA). Contractors check email from phones between jobs — not at desks at 9 AM (Contractors Creative). Every industry has a native language. Outreach that doesn't speak it gets deleted.

**Infrastructure matched to the vertical.** Healthcare organizations use aggressive spam filtering that blocks standard sending infrastructure (Portiva). Crypto and AI company inboxes are saturated with spam that requires enterprise Azure infrastructure to penetrate (Jacob Tyler, Growth Squad). Corporate Fortune 500 environments filter differently than SMB Gmail inboxes (Telescope, INTUIFY). One infrastructure setup doesn't fit all industries.

## Not Sure Which Industry Approach Fits?

Some companies span multiple industries or sell to buyers in verticals they don't operate in. A SaaS company selling to healthcare needs healthcare's targeting signals combined with SaaS's proof approach. A creative agency selling to e-commerce needs e-commerce's category-matched messaging with agency-style proof points.

The strategy call covers which industry playbook applies to your specific ICP, deal size, and market dynamics — and whether a single-industry or cross-industry approach fits best.

  <Accordion title="What if my industry isn't listed here?">
    These 14 industries cover the majority of B2B outbound use cases based on 44 documented campaigns. The underlying methodology — infrastructure-first deliverability, signal-based targeting, and vertical-specific messaging — applies to any B2B company where average deal value justifies outbound investment (generally $5K+). The [strategy call](https://outboundsystem.com/book) covers whether the existing frameworks apply to your market or whether a custom approach is needed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How is industry-specific outbound different from just changing the copy?">
    Copy is one of five variables. Industry-specific outbound also changes the targeting logic (what signals identify ready buyers), the infrastructure configuration (deliverability requirements vary by industry email environment), the channel mix (contractors need phone, creators need LinkedIn, enterprise needs all three), and the cadence (healthcare moves slowly, DTC moves fast). Changing only the copy while keeping everything else generic produces generic results.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Which industries have the strongest case study data?">
    Agencies and professional services have the deepest dataset with 14 case studies across specialties from SEO to PR to web design. SaaS has 7 case studies spanning HR tech to enterprise AI. Financial services, e-commerce, and video production each have 3-4 case studies with strong ROI data. Every industry listed above has at least one verified case study with full metrics. Browse the [complete case study library](/case-studies) to filter by industry.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can outbound work for industries with long sales cycles?">
    Yes — several of the strongest campaigns operate in long-cycle industries. Equity Front Capital ran a 10-month campaign producing 122 meetings in private equity. Closify sustained 52 responses/month for 11 months in SaaS sales talent. Portiva maintained 31 responses/month for 9 months in healthcare. Long-cycle industries benefit from outbound's compounding effect: early leads continue converting months after initial contact while new pipeline builds.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I need to commit to one industry or can campaigns target multiple?">
    Campaigns can target multiple industries simultaneously using separate messaging tracks. Many clients run parallel campaigns — for example, an IT services company targeting both CPA firms (Boost Speed's approach) and AI startups (App Labs' approach) with completely different targeting, messaging, and proof points. The infrastructure supports multiple campaigns without deliverability conflicts.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I know which industry approach is right for my business?">
    Start with your buyer's industry, not yours. If you sell SaaS to healthcare, the healthcare playbook governs your targeting and messaging — because that's the inbox you need to reach and the buyer language you need to speak. The [industry playbooks](/playbooks/industry-playbooks) provide the tactical framework, and the [strategy call](https://outboundsystem.com/book) maps it to your specific situation.

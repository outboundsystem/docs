# Lead Generation for Events & Experiential Companies

Events and experiential companies sell into one of the most relationship-driven, seasonally constrained B2B markets: buyers plan 60-90 days ahead, decision-makers are notoriously hard to identify (event directors, not info@ addresses), and the value proposition shifts completely depending on event type. Aegeus Bands generated $98K from 7 deals — an 807% ROI — by segmenting outreach across music festivals, corporate conferences, and brand activations with event-type-specific messaging and six-source decision-maker verification.

## Why Events Outbound Is Different

Event services companies face unique outbound challenges that generic approaches can't solve:

**Value propositions shift across event types.** A music festival organizer cares about crowd energy and production quality. A corporate conference planner cares about professionalism and logistics reliability. A brand activation manager cares about audience engagement metrics and brand alignment. One message doesn't serve all three. Aegeus Bands' 7 closed deals came from separate messaging tracks for each event type.

**Seasonal buying windows are narrow.** Event planners make vendor decisions 60-90 days before event dates. Outreach that arrives 2 weeks before the event is too late. Outreach that arrives 6 months out is too early. Calendar-synchronized outbound that matches the planning cycle is the single highest-leverage variable.

**Decision-maker identification is the primary bottleneck.** Unlike SaaS or financial services where titles are standardized, event decision-makers carry varied titles: event director, head of experiences, VP brand marketing, operations lead. Six-source verification across LinkedIn, company websites, event databases, social media, industry directories, and direct research is required to find the actual decision-maker rather than wasting outreach on gatekeepers.

**Six-source decision-maker verification:** Standard list building identifies "event coordinator" titles from LinkedIn. In events, the actual decision-maker might be titled "Head of Experiences," "VP Brand Marketing," or "Festival Operations Director." Six-source verification cross-references LinkedIn, company websites, event industry databases, social media, industry directories, and direct research to identify the person who actually selects vendors — not the person who answers the info@ inbox.

## How We Target Events Buyers

| Targeting Criteria | Details |
|---|---|
| **Primary Titles** | Event directors, operations leads, brand experience managers, heads of experiential |
| **Organization Types** | Event production companies, brands with active event programs, venues, festivals, conference organizers |
| **Segmentation** | By event type — music festivals, corporate conferences, sporting events, brand activations each get separate campaigns |
| **Signal Filters** | Upcoming event announcements, event planning cycles (60-90 day window), venue bookings, event staffing posts |
| **Infrastructure** | Azure U.S. IP for deliverability past promotions tabs |
| **Exclusions** | One-off personal events, organizations with exclusive vendor contracts, events under $10K production budget |

## Our Events Outbound Approach

<Steps>

  <Step title="Event-Type Segmentation">

    Each event type gets its own campaign with tailored messaging, proof points, and CTAs. Festival organizers hear about crowd engagement and production scale. Corporate planners hear about logistics reliability and professionalism. Brand activation managers hear about audience metrics and brand alignment. Aegeus Bands ran parallel campaigns for each segment.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Calendar-Synchronized Outreach">

    Campaigns are timed to hit during the 60-90 day planning window before event dates. This requires building event calendars by market — festival schedules, conference series, corporate event seasons — and synchronizing send timing to catch planners when decisions are active. Outreach outside this window produces minimal results.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Six-Source Decision-Maker Verification">

    Before any message sends, decision-makers are verified across six sources to ensure outreach reaches the person who selects vendors — not a gatekeeper or general inbox. This verification step adds time to list building but dramatically improves response rates because every email lands with someone who has purchasing authority.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Multi-Channel Event Engagement">

    LinkedIn is particularly effective for events because planners are active networkers. Content engagement around event industry topics, connection requests referencing upcoming events, and email sequences with event-specific proof create the multi-touch familiarity that relationship-driven buyers require.

  </Step>

</Steps>

<Tip>

**Events trigger events:** Upcoming event announcements (60-90 day window), event planning cycles visible in industry calendars, venue booking announcements (vendor selection imminent), event staffing posts (production team being assembled), and post-event hiring (satisfaction or dissatisfaction with current vendors creating evaluation openings).

## What Makes Events Outbound Fail

**One message for all event types.** Festival organizers and corporate conference planners have fundamentally different priorities. Generic "we provide event services" messaging fails both audiences. Event-type segmentation isn't optional — it's the mechanism that produces relevance.

**Missing the planning window.** Event vendors are selected 60-90 days before event dates. Outreach outside this window — too early or too late — produces near-zero results regardless of messaging quality. Calendar synchronization is the highest-leverage variable in events outbound.

**Sending to info@ addresses instead of decision-makers.** Events companies without six-source verification waste outreach on general inboxes, assistants, and coordinators who can't make vendor decisions. Decision-maker verification is the bottleneck that separates productive campaigns from expensive noise.

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="How many deals can an events company expect from outbound?">
    Aegeus Bands closed 7 deals from 29 meetings over 6 months — roughly 1 deal per month with a 24% meeting-to-deal conversion rate. Events deals tend to be higher-value and relationship-based, so volume is lower than SaaS or agency outbound, but deal values and repeat business potential are significant.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does outbound work for events companies that rely on relationships?">
    Outbound doesn't replace relationship-based selling — it systematizes the first touch that starts the relationship. Aegeus Bands' 7 deals all began with outbound and converted through relationship-building conversations. The outbound system creates introductions; the events company's expertise and personality close the deal.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do you handle the seasonality of events?">
    Campaign volume adjusts to match event planning cycles. Festival season outreach intensifies 60-90 days before summer and fall events. Corporate conference outreach ramps during Q4 planning for Q1 events. Off-season messaging shifts to early-bird planning and next-season positioning.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What types of event services work best with outbound?">
    Entertainment, production, technology, staffing, and experiential services all work with outbound because they all face the same planning-cycle timing and decision-maker identification challenges. The key variable is deal value — services with average engagements above $5K justify the outbound investment.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How long does it take to see results in the events industry?">
    Initial meetings typically appear within 3-4 weeks of campaign launch, assuming the outreach is timed to active planning windows. Revenue realization depends on event timelines — deals closed in the planning phase generate revenue when the event occurs. Aegeus Bands generated $98K over 6 months, reflecting the events industry's project-based revenue cycle.

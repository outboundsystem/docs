# Frequently Asked Questions

Outbound System runs done-for-you multi-channel outbound — cold email, LinkedIn, and AI-powered cold calling — on month-to-month contracts with campaigns launching in as few as 5 days. Below are direct answers to the questions prospects ask most, covering how the service works, what results to expect, and why the infrastructure matters.

## Service & Process

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="How quickly can we get started?">
    AI cold calling campaigns go live in 5 days — that includes strategy, scripting, your approval, and system calibration. Cold email campaigns launch in 14 days (setup takes 48 hours, the rest is inbox warmup to ensure 99% deliverability from day one). LinkedIn campaigns launch in 3–5 days. Compare that to most agencies that take 2–4 weeks to launch calling and 2–3 months for email, then another quarter before you see real results. We've had clients booking meetings within the first week live.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What results can I expect in the first 30/60/90 days?">
    Results vary by ICP and market, but here's what the data shows across 10,400+ campaigns. In the first 30 days, infrastructure is fully live, messaging is tested, and initial meetings start booking — FireVibe Web Design booked 15 meetings and closed 2 deals in month one. By day 60, campaigns are optimized based on real reply and conversation data, and most clients scale to multi-channel. By day 90, you're at full volume with proven messaging. Alo Media Group hit 35 meetings in 90 days with a 31% reply rate. PlantSwitch booked 330 meetings across 12 months. Clients running AI calling alongside email and LinkedIn see 2–3x the meetings compared to single-channel outbound. Month 1 is your baseline. By month 3, your campaign is operating at a level that static agency campaigns never reach.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do you work with companies in my industry?">
    We've run 10,400+ campaigns across every major B2B vertical — SaaS, IT staffing, professional services, healthcare, construction, food service, real estate, financial services, manufacturing, and more. Every campaign is built around your specific ICP, industry language, and value proposition. When we ran campaigns for PlantSwitch targeting restaurant decision-makers, scripts focused on supply cost savings because that's what food service directors care about. When we targeted funded SaaS companies for Alo Media Group, messaging referenced CAC reduction and recent funding rounds. The targeting logic and messaging shift entirely by vertical.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if I've had a bad experience with another agency?">
    You should be skeptical — most agencies earn that skepticism. They lock you into 6-month contracts, run single-channel campaigns with generic copy, send a vague PDF once a month, and hope you don't ask hard questions. Here's what's different: month-to-month contracts so you can cancel anytime. Multi-channel by default (email, LinkedIn, and AI calling — not an upsell). Real-time dashboards showing exactly what's being sent, to whom, and what's converting. 24/7 AI response handling so warm leads don't go cold. And 10,400+ campaigns of data informing every decision. One IT staffing founder who had tried Instantly, Smartlead, and two agencies booked 22 meetings in his first month after switching. We've had clients book more meetings in month one than their previous agency delivered in a full quarter.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How is your infrastructure different?">
    Deliverability is the foundation because the best copy in the world doesn't matter if it hits spam. For cold email, we use dedicated USA IPs, private Microsoft Azure hosting, 100+ Outlook inboxes per campaign, SPF/DKIM/DMARC authentication on every domain, MX-based routing, and natural sending patterns — producing 99% inbox placement rates at volume. For LinkedIn, each session runs inside an antidetect browser with a unique fingerprint, dedicated residential proxies with consistent IP routing, human-like activity schedules, and adaptive daily limits that recalculate based on real-time account health scoring. For AI cold calling, the system combines advanced conversational intelligence with proven B2B frameworks — real-time two-way conversations that adapt based on what the prospect says, not pre-recorded messages or phone trees. Most agencies use shared infrastructure, detectable automation, and static configurations. Our system is engineered differently at every layer.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What does the pricing include?">
    Every campaign includes dedicated infrastructure, prospect list building with signal-based targeting, AI-powered personalized copywriting for all channels, 24/7 AI response handling, real-time dashboards, and a dedicated U.S.-based account manager. Multi-channel is the default — cold email, LinkedIn outreach, and AI cold calling run as an integrated system. AI cold calling starts at $999/month for up to 250 dials per day (approximately 5,000/month), with a Scale tier at $1,999/month for up to 500 dials per day. Both tiers include script writing, DNC/TCPA scrubbing, qualified lead list building, CRM integrations, meetings booked directly on your calendar, and real-time campaign metrics. You approve all messaging before launch with 100% script adherence. See our [pricing breakdown](/pricing) for full details.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I scale up or down?">
    Scaling is built into every channel. For AI cold calling, upgrade your plan anytime — go from 250 dials/day to 500 or 1,000+ without rebuilding anything. The infrastructure, scripts, and targeting logic carry forward, and you can run multiple ICP campaigns simultaneously at higher tiers. For email, add inboxes, sending credits, and validation capacity at discounted rates. Most clients start with one channel or tier, see the meeting volume, and scale within 60–90 days. The multi-channel system can reach your entire TAM every 60 days, so the ceiling is high. Scaling down is equally simple — month-to-month contracts mean you adjust capacity to match your pipeline goals.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the contract length?">
    Month-to-month. No 3-month minimums, no 6-month lock-ins. Cancel anytime with 10 business days' notice. Month-to-month is a forcing function: we deliver results every 30 days, or you leave. Most agencies lock you in for 3–6 months because they need that runway to justify setup costs. We don't, because AI calling is live in 5 days, email in 14 days, and all channels produce results from week one. That accountability is a big reason 70+ clients came from referrals and we maintain a 4.8-star rating across Trustpilot and G2.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do you handle responses?">
    Every reply across all channels is processed using 24/7 AI response handling with proven conversion frameworks built on 10,400+ campaigns of data. On AI cold calls, interested prospects are booked into a meeting directly during the conversation — no "we'll send you an email to schedule." The system qualifies interest, handles objections in real time, and books the appointment while buying signals are at their peak. For email and LinkedIn, replies are processed within 10 minutes. "Tell me more" replies get tailored follow-up. "Not right now" replies go into a warm re-engagement database. Even objections get converted into booked calls. The biggest gap in outbound isn't sending messages — it's converting interest into pipeline.
  </Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## AI Cold Calling

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="How does your AI-powered calling actually work?">
    The system combines advanced conversational intelligence with proven B2B cold calling frameworks. When a prospect picks up, they experience a natural, context-aware conversation tailored to their industry, role, and business challenges. The AI adapts in real time — handling objections, qualifying interest, and booking meetings directly on your calendar when buying signals appear. Every call follows scripts built from data across 10,400+ campaigns. You approve all messaging before a single dial is made, and every conversation is recorded so you can hear exactly how prospects are being engaged. This isn't a pre-recorded message or a phone tree — it's a real-time, two-way conversation that adapts based on what the prospect says.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Will prospects know they're talking to an AI system?">
    Rarely. The voice quality is indistinguishable from a real person. The AI agents use natural-sounding voice technology that mirrors the tone, pacing, and inflection of a professional human caller — no robotic pauses, no unnatural cadence, no synthetic artifacts. Every call is scripted with natural language patterns, not stiff corporate talk. The conversation flows the way a real dialogue would, with natural transitions, appropriate responses to what the prospect says, and personalized context (their industry, their role, their specific challenges) that makes it feel like the caller did their homework. Prospects engage because the experience feels authentic, relevant, and professional.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How is this different from robocalling or autodialers?">
    Completely different category. Robocalls blast pre-recorded messages to thousands of random numbers. Our system has real-time, two-way conversations with targeted decision-makers at companies that match your ideal customer profile. Every call is personalized to the prospect's industry and role. Objections are handled live. Qualification happens on the call. Meetings are booked in the moment, not passed off to a follow-up email. The system is built on data from thousands of successful B2B campaigns, and every conversation is engineered to be relevant, professional, and consultative.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the AI cold calling process?">
    The full cycle runs in 5 days. Days 1–2: your U.S.-based account manager builds the campaign — target buyer profile, messaging angles, objection handling, qualification criteria, and a battle-tested script. You approve everything. Days 3–4: the system is configured for your business, value proposition, buyer language, and industry objection patterns, then tested extensively. Day 5: calls begin, meetings appear on your calendar, and your real-time dashboard goes live with dials, connections, conversations, meetings, and conversion rates. From there, weekly optimization on opening lines, objection responses, prospect segments, and conversation paths — this is where every other provider stops, and where the real compounding advantage begins. Learn more in our [AI cold calling service overview](/services/cold-calling).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What about TCPA and TSR compliance?">
    Compliance is built into the infrastructure, not bolted on as an afterthought. Every campaign includes national and state DNC registry scrubbing before any dial is made, dynamic integration with your internal do-not-call list, clear caller identification and purpose disclosure at the start of every conversation, opt-out requests honored immediately, and all calls placed only between 8:00 AM and 6:00 PM in the recipient's local time zone. We've run thousands of cold calling campaigns without compliance issues because the system is engineered to prevent them.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Which industries does AI calling work best for?">
    AI-powered calling produces strong results across most B2B verticals, but it's especially effective for audiences who are phone-responsive or hard to reach via email: local service businesses, contractors, healthcare practice owners, food service directors, real estate brokerages, and operational decision-makers at mid-market companies. For PlantSwitch, calling reached food service directors who rarely check email — 330 meetings in 12 months. For Veritas Ads targeting local businesses, calling drove a 42% reply rate. For enterprise accounts, AI calling serves as the strategic closer for prospects who engaged with email but hadn't booked. Your account manager will recommend the right plan and channel mix based on your specific ICP's behavior.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How many dials does it take to book a meeting?">
    This varies by industry, title seniority, and how well the prospect has been warmed by email and LinkedIn first. Multi-channel campaigns consistently book meetings at a lower cost-per-dial because prospects already recognize your name when the call comes in, which dramatically increases pickup and conversion rates. At 250–1,000+ dials per day, even conservative connection and conversion rates produce significant meeting volume. We optimize continuously based on real data: if a segment isn't converting, we adjust targeting, script, or call timing within the same week. The goal isn't maximum dials — it's maximum qualified meetings booked.
  </Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## LinkedIn Outreach

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="How does LinkedIn outreach work?">
    We build targeted prospect lists using LinkedIn Sales Navigator with advanced Boolean filtering and signal-based targeting — funding rounds, hiring surges, leadership changes, tech adoption. We write AI-personalized connection requests and follow-up messages that reference real prospect data, not generic templates. Outreach runs from your LinkedIn account (or dedicated accounts we provide), protected by antidetect browser technology, residential proxies, human-like activity schedules, and adaptive daily limits. Every reply is handled within 10 minutes using conversion frameworks. You approve 100% of messaging before launch. MBO Ventures hit a 27% reply rate targeting business owners for ESOP transactions using this system. Read the full breakdown in our [LinkedIn outreach service page](/services/linkedin-outreach).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Will LinkedIn outreach get my account flagged?">
    No — and this isn't just a promise, it's an infrastructure difference. Each LinkedIn session runs inside an antidetect browser with a unique human-like fingerprint. Dedicated residential proxies provide consistent IP routing per profile. Activity follows human-like daily schedules with full offline periods. Adaptive limits recalculate based on real-time account health scoring. Accounts go through a calibrated warm-up protocol before volume scales. Most agencies use shared proxy pools, detectable browser environments, and static daily limits — which is why accounts get flagged. Our system eliminates every signal LinkedIn's detection looks for: robotic timing, suspicious fingerprints, unusual login locations, and activity spikes. You can also run from dedicated accounts we provide if you prefer to keep your personal profile separate.
  </Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## Reporting, Infrastructure & Integration

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="What CRM integrations do you support?">
    Campaigns feed into your existing CRM through direct integrations and real-time dashboards. You see dials made, connections, conversations, meetings booked, objections logged, reply rates, and conversion rates across every segment — updated live, not in a monthly PDF. Your account manager will walk through integration setup during onboarding to ensure pipeline data flows directly into your existing sales workflow.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do you protect my domain reputation?">
    Domain reputation is protected through infrastructure design. Every campaign uses dedicated domains separate from your primary domain, so outbound volume never touches your main email reputation. Each domain gets full SPF/DKIM/DMARC authentication, dedicated USA IPs, private Microsoft Azure hosting, and MX-based routing. We run 100+ Outlook inboxes per campaign with natural sending patterns that mirror human behavior. Inboxes go through a calibrated warmup protocol, and we provide a deliverability report confirming 99% inbox placement before full volume begins. For LinkedIn, antidetect browser sessions and residential proxies protect your account from platform restrictions. See our [deliverability guide](/knowledge-base/deliverability-guide) for the full technical breakdown.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if I already have some outbound infrastructure?">
    We'll assess what you have and integrate anything that meets our deliverability standards. If your existing email infrastructure is solid — properly warmed, fully authenticated, clean IPs — we fold it into the campaign. If it has issues (poor warmup, missing authentication, shared IPs), we'll flag the specific problems and build clean infrastructure alongside it. For LinkedIn, if a previous provider got your account flagged, our antidetect system is fundamentally different from the shared automation tools that caused the restriction. You're not starting from scratch and you're not paying for redundant setup.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do you measure success?">
    Real-time dashboards track every metric that matters across all channels: emails sent, open rates, reply rates, positive reply rates, meetings booked, connection acceptance rates, dials made, conversations held, objections logged, and conversion rates across every segment. This isn't activity reporting — it's pipeline intelligence. We track which scripts, subject lines, opening lines, and objection handles convert best, then optimize weekly based on real performance data. If a certain ICP segment isn't responding, you see it in real-time and we adjust the approach — not three months into a contract when your budget is already spent.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the minimum commitment?">
    One month. Month-to-month contracts with 10 business days' notice to cancel. No minimum duration, no setup fee lock-in, no penalty for leaving. AI cold calling is live in 5 days and email campaigns launch within 14 days — because proper inbox warmup and domain authentication can't be rushed if you want 99% deliverability from day one.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I see your work before signing?">
    You can review 100+ published case studies with full metrics, timelines, and client details on our [case studies page](/case-studies). These include specific numbers: meetings booked, reply rates, pipeline generated, ROI, and revenue closed. You can also check our 4.8-star rating across Trustpilot and G2 with reviews from 70+ clients. During your initial call, your account manager will walk through campaigns relevant to your industry, ICP, and company size so you can see exactly what the system produced for businesses like yours.
  </Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## Common Objections

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="We tried outbound before and it didn't work.">
    That's the most common thing we hear from new clients — and it's usually traceable to one of three root causes. First, bad infrastructure: shared IPs, no authentication, poor warmup, messages landing in spam. Second, bad targeting: spraying generic messages at anyone who matches a job title filter instead of identifying prospects actively experiencing the problem you solve. Third, single-channel execution: running email only and hitting a fraction of your TAM. We fix all three. Infrastructure runs on dedicated USA IPs with 99% inbox placement. Targeting is signal-based. And multi-channel is the default — email, LinkedIn, and AI calling delivering 5,000+ touchpoints daily. One IT staffing founder who had tried Instantly, Smartlead, and two agencies booked 22 meetings in his first month with us. Month-to-month means you'll know within 30 days whether this is different.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="We already have an internal team.">
    Good — that means you understand outbound works. The question is whether your current team is operating at full capacity. Most in-house SDRs max out at 50–80 dials on a good day with inconsistent messaging and call reluctance. Our AI calling system delivers 250–1,000 dials per day with 100% script adherence, plus cold email and LinkedIn running simultaneously. One client replaced two SDRs, tripled their meetings, and achieved 73% lower cost per meeting. An in-house SDR costs $50K–$80K/year fully loaded. Our AI calling starts at $999/month. You don't have to replace your team — we can augment them. Your reps focus on warm conversations and closing while we fill the top of the funnel. Most clients who start as augmentation eventually shift more volume to us once they see the cost-per-meeting comparison.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Cold email is dead / doesn't work.">
    Generic cold email sent from shared infrastructure to untargeted lists is dead — and should be. Signal-based cold email with enterprise-grade deliverability is producing some of the strongest pipeline numbers in B2B. Alo Media Group hit a 31% reply rate and 35 meetings in 90 days. Ku Creatives booked 66 meetings in 7 months. PlantSwitch generated 330 meetings in 12 months. The difference is infrastructure (dedicated IPs, 100+ Outlook inboxes, SPF/DKIM/DMARC on every domain, 99% inbox placement), targeting (signal-based identification of prospects experiencing the problem you solve), and personalization (AI-powered references to real prospect data, not merge-tag mail merges). Cold email works when the execution is right.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Your pricing is too high.">
    Compare the math. An in-house SDR costs $50K–$80K/year fully loaded, takes 3–6 months to ramp, averages 50–80 dials per day, and carries 50% annual turnover — every departure resets the cycle. Other agencies charge $4,000–$8,000/month for one human caller juggling 2–4 other clients, making 150–300 dials promised but 100–150 delivered. Our AI cold calling starts at $999/month and delivers 250 dials per day — more daily outreach than an entire SDR team produces in a week. The Scale tier at $1,999/month delivers 500 dials per day. Both include script writing, lead list building, DNC scrubbing, CRM integrations, meetings booked on your calendar, and a dedicated U.S. account manager. The question isn't whether the price is high — it's what the cost per qualified meeting is compared to every alternative. Month-to-month contracts mean you validate that comparison in 30 days with zero long-term risk.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="We need to think about it.">
    That's reasonable — this is a pipeline decision, not an impulse buy. Here's what we'd suggest: review the 100+ published case studies on our [case studies page](/case-studies) and find clients in your industry or company size bracket. Look at the specific metrics — meetings booked, timelines, reply rates, ROI. Then book a second call where your account manager walks through exactly what a campaign would look like for your ICP, including targeting criteria, messaging angles, channel mix, and expected benchmarks. Month-to-month contracts with 10 business days' cancellation mean the downside of starting is one month. The downside of waiting is every month of pipeline you're not building.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I don't want to damage my brand with cold outreach.">
    Bad outbound damages brands. Untrained SDRs going off-script, pushing too hard, or calling the wrong person at the wrong time — that's what creates negative brand associations. Our AI system eliminates those risks entirely. Every message across every channel follows your approved scripts with 100% adherence. AI cold calls use natural voice technology with consultative, professional conversations — no robotic pauses, no aggressive pitching. Cold email runs through 99% inbox-placement infrastructure. LinkedIn outreach references real prospect activity. DNC-scrubbed call lists ensure you never dial someone who shouldn't be called. Time-zone compliance means no early morning interruptions. Outbound System delivers thousands of professional touchpoints daily that build awareness with your exact ICP — the opposite of the spray-and-pray approach that gives outbound a bad name.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="We're worried about LinkedIn account safety.">
    That concern is valid — most LinkedIn automation tools get accounts restricted because they use shared proxy pools, detectable browser environments, and static daily limits. Our infrastructure is fundamentally different at every layer. Each session runs inside an antidetect browser with a unique human-like fingerprint. Dedicated residential proxies provide consistent IP routing per profile. Activity follows human-like schedules with full offline periods. Adaptive limits recalculate based on real-time account health scoring. Accounts go through a calibrated warm-up protocol before volume scales. We've run thousands of LinkedIn campaigns without the account safety issues common with other providers. You can also run from dedicated accounts we provide if you prefer to keep your personal profile separate.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="AI calling sounds like robocalling.">
    Completely different category. Robocalls blast pre-recorded messages to thousands of random numbers. Our system has real-time, two-way conversations with targeted decision-makers at companies that match your ICP. Every call is personalized to the prospect's industry, role, and business challenges. The AI adapts in real time — objections are handled live, qualification happens on the call, and meetings are booked in the moment. The voice is indistinguishable from a professional human caller: natural tone, pacing, and inflection with no robotic artifacts. Prospects engage because the conversation is relevant, consultative, and sounds like someone who actually researched their business. This is intelligent outreach built on data from 10,400+ B2B campaigns, not spam.

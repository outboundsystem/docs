# Frequently Asked Questions

Outbound System runs done-for-you multi-channel outbound (cold email, LinkedIn, and AI cold calling) on month-to-month contracts with campaigns launching in 14 days. Below are direct answers to the questions prospects ask most — covering how the service works, what results to expect, and why the infrastructure matters.

## Service & Process

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="How quickly can we get started?">
    Campaigns go live in 14 days. Setup itself takes less than 48 hours — the remaining time is spent warming inboxes and domains to ensure 99% inbox placement from day one. LinkedIn campaigns launch in 3–5 days, and cold calling campaigns launch in 7–14 days depending on script complexity and your feedback speed. Compare that to most agencies that take 2–3 months to launch and another quarter before you see real results. We've had clients book meetings in their first week live.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What results can I expect in the first 30/60/90 days?">
    Results vary by ICP and market, but here's what the data shows across 10,400+ campaigns. In the first 30 days, infrastructure is fully live, messaging is tested, and initial meetings start booking — FireVibe Web Design booked 15 meetings and closed 2 deals in month one. By day 60, campaigns are optimized based on real reply data and most clients scale to multi-channel. By day 90, you're at full volume with proven messaging. Alo Media Group hit 35 meetings in 90 days with a 31% reply rate. Ku Creatives averaged 38 qualified responses per month and booked 66 meetings across 7 months. PlantSwitch booked 330 meetings in 12 months. The trajectory depends on your market — your account manager will set specific benchmarks during onboarding.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do you work with companies in my industry?">
    We've run 10,400+ campaigns across every major B2B vertical — SaaS, IT staffing, professional services, healthcare, construction, food service, real estate, financial services, manufacturing, and more. Every campaign is built around your specific ICP, industry language, and value proposition. When we ran campaigns for PlantSwitch targeting restaurant decision-makers, we built scripts around supply cost savings because that's what food service directors care about. When we targeted funded SaaS companies for Alo Media Group, we referenced CAC reduction and recent funding rounds. The targeting logic and messaging shift entirely by vertical — we're not running the same playbook for every client.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if I've had a bad experience with another agency?">
    You should be skeptical — most agencies earn that skepticism. They lock you into 6-month contracts, run single-channel campaigns with generic copy, send a vague PDF once a month, and hope you don't ask hard questions. Here's what's different: month-to-month contracts so you can cancel anytime. Multi-channel by default (email, LinkedIn, and phone — not an upsell). Real-time dashboards showing exactly what's being sent, to whom, and what's converting. 24/7 AI response handling so warm leads don't go cold. And 10,400+ campaigns of data informing every decision. One IT staffing founder who had already tried Instantly, Smartlead, and two agencies booked 22 meetings in his first month after switching. We've had clients book more meetings in month one than their previous agency delivered in a full quarter.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How is your infrastructure different?">
    Deliverability is the foundation because the best copy in the world doesn't matter if it hits spam. For cold email, we use dedicated USA IPs, private Microsoft Azure hosting, 100+ Outlook inboxes per campaign, SPF/DKIM/DMARC authentication on every domain, MX-based routing, and natural sending patterns — producing 99% inbox placement rates at volume. For LinkedIn, each session runs inside an antidetect browser with a unique fingerprint, dedicated residential proxies with consistent IP routing, human-like activity schedules, and adaptive daily limits that recalculate based on real-time account health scoring. Most agencies use shared proxy pools, detectable browser environments, and static daily limits — which is why accounts get flagged. Our system is engineered to make automated outreach indistinguishable from manual activity at the browser, network, and behavioral level.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What does the pricing include?">
    Every campaign includes dedicated infrastructure (inboxes, domains, authentication), prospect list building with six-source verification and signal-based targeting, AI-powered personalized copywriting for all channels, 24/7 AI response handling, real-time dashboards, and a dedicated U.S.-based account manager. Multi-channel is the default — cold email, LinkedIn outreach, and AI cold calling run as an integrated system delivering 5,000+ touchpoints daily. You approve all messaging before launch with 100% script approval. Scaling add-ons are available at discounted rates: 10,000 additional monthly sends plus 5,000 validation credits per add-on. See our [pricing breakdown](/pricing) for full details.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I scale up or down?">
    Scaling is built into the model. When you're ready, we add inboxes, sending credits, email validation capacity, and additional SDRs without rebuilding anything — the infrastructure, scripts, and targeting logic are already proven. Most clients start with one campaign and scale to multi-channel within 60–90 days once they see meeting volume. Cold calling alone can go from 10,000 dials per month to 30,000+ by adding SDRs. The multi-channel system can reach your entire TAM every 60 days, so the ceiling is high. Scaling down is equally simple — month-to-month contracts mean you adjust capacity to match your pipeline goals.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the contract length?">
    Month-to-month. No 3-month minimums, no 6-month lock-ins. Cancel anytime with 10 business days' notice. Month-to-month is a forcing function: we deliver results every 30 days, or you leave. That accountability is a big reason 70+ clients came from referrals and we maintain a 4.8-star rating across Trustpilot and G2.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do you handle responses?">
    Every reply across all channels is processed using 24/7 AI response handling with proven conversion frameworks built on 10,400+ campaigns of data. Interested prospects get booked into a meeting directly — on cold calls, the caller books the appointment in real time while interest is at its peak. "Tell me more" replies get tailored follow-up. "Not right now" replies go into a warm re-engagement database. Even objections are handled using frameworks that convert hesitation into booked calls. On LinkedIn specifically, replies are processed within 10 minutes and connection accepts without a reply trigger a strategic follow-up sequence. The biggest gap in outbound isn't sending messages — it's converting interest into pipeline.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's your cold calling process?">
    All callers are based in Mexico and the Philippines with 3+ years of successful B2B cold calling experience. They're trained on your specific ICP, industry language, and value proposition before making a single dial. Every caller follows your approved script with 100% adherence — no going off-script, no improvising. We deliver up to 10,000 dials per month per campaign, which is the volume of an entire SDR team without the $75K–$120K salary, 3–6 month ramp, or 50% annual turnover. Scripts are built by your U.S.-based account manager using performance data from 10,400+ campaigns. Compliance is engineered in: DNC scrubbing before every dial, calls only between 8:00 AM and 6:00 PM in the recipient's local time zone, and clear caller identity disclosure. Learn more in our [cold calling service overview](/services/cold-calling).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does LinkedIn outreach work?">
    We build targeted prospect lists using LinkedIn Sales Navigator with advanced Boolean filtering and signal-based targeting — funding rounds, hiring surges, leadership changes, tech adoption. We write AI-personalized connection requests and follow-up messages that reference real prospect data, not generic templates. Outreach runs from your LinkedIn account (or dedicated accounts we provide), protected by antidetect browser technology, residential proxies, human-like activity schedules, and adaptive daily limits. Every reply is handled within 10 minutes using conversion frameworks. You approve 100% of messaging before launch. MBO Ventures hit a 27% reply rate targeting business owners for ESOP transactions using this system. Read the full breakdown in our [LinkedIn outreach service page](/services/linkedin-outreach).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What CRM integrations do you support?">
    Campaigns feed into your existing CRM through real-time dashboards and standard integration workflows. You see dials made, connections, conversations, meetings booked, objections logged, reply rates, and conversion rates across every segment — updated live, not in a monthly PDF. If something isn't working, you see it in real-time and we adjust the same week. Your account manager will walk through integration setup during onboarding to ensure pipeline data flows directly into your existing sales workflow.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do you protect my domain reputation?">
    Domain reputation is protected through infrastructure design, not afterthought fixes. Every campaign uses dedicated domains separate from your primary domain, so outbound volume never touches your main email reputation. Each domain gets full SPF/DKIM/DMARC authentication, dedicated USA IPs, private Microsoft Azure hosting, and MX-based routing. We run 100+ Outlook inboxes per campaign with natural sending patterns that mirror human behavior. Inboxes go through a calibrated warmup protocol before scaling, and we provide a deliverability report confirming 99% inbox placement before full volume begins. For LinkedIn, antidetect browser sessions and residential proxies protect your account from platform restrictions. See our [deliverability guide](/knowledge-base/deliverability-guide) for the full technical breakdown.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if I already have some outbound infrastructure?">
    We'll assess what you have and integrate anything that meets our deliverability standards. If your existing infrastructure is solid — properly warmed, fully authenticated, clean IPs — we fold it into the campaign. If it has issues (poor warmup, missing authentication, shared IPs — and most does), we'll flag the specific problems and build clean infrastructure alongside it. You're not starting from scratch and you're not paying for redundant setup. For LinkedIn, if your previous provider got your account flagged, our antidetect browser system, dedicated residential proxies, and adaptive limits are fundamentally different at every layer from the shared automation tools that caused the restriction.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do you measure success?">
    Real-time dashboards track every metric that matters: emails sent, open rates, reply rates, positive reply rates, meetings booked, connection acceptance rates, dials made, conversations held, objections logged, and conversion rates across every segment and channel. This isn't activity reporting — it's pipeline intelligence. We track which scripts, subject lines, opening lines, and objection handles convert best, then optimize weekly based on real performance data. You see what's working and what's not on day one, not three months into a contract.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the minimum commitment?">
    One month. Month-to-month contracts with 10 business days' notice to cancel. There is no minimum duration, no setup fee lock-in, and no penalty for leaving. The only commitment we ask for is the 14-day launch timeline — because proper inbox warmup and domain authentication can't be rushed if you want 99% deliverability from day one.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I see your work before signing?">
    You can review 44 published case studies with full metrics, timelines, and client details on our [case studies page](/case-studies). These include specific numbers: meetings booked, reply rates, pipeline generated, ROI, and revenue closed. You can also check our 4.8-star rating across Trustpilot and G2 with reviews from 70+ clients. During your initial call, your account manager will walk through campaigns relevant to your industry, ICP, and company size so you can see exactly what the system produced for businesses like yours.

## Common Objections

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="We tried outbound before and it didn't work.">
    That's the most common thing we hear from new clients — and it's usually traceable to one of three root causes. First, bad infrastructure: shared IPs, no authentication, poor warmup, messages landing in spam. Second, bad targeting: spraying generic messages at anyone who matches a job title filter instead of identifying prospects actively experiencing the problem you solve. Third, single-channel execution: running email only and hitting a fraction of your TAM. We fix all three. Infrastructure runs on dedicated USA IPs with 99% inbox placement. Targeting is signal-based — funding rounds, hiring surges, tech stack changes. And multi-channel is the default, delivering 5,000+ touchpoints daily across email, LinkedIn, and phone. One IT staffing founder who had tried Instantly, Smartlead, and two agencies booked 22 meetings in his first month with us. Month-to-month means you'll know within 30 days whether this is different.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="We already have an internal team.">
    Good — that means you understand outbound works. The question is whether your current team is operating at full capacity. Most in-house SDRs max out at 50–80 dials on a good day with inconsistent messaging and call reluctance. We deliver 10,000 dials per month with 100% script adherence, plus cold email and LinkedIn running simultaneously. One client replaced two SDRs, tripled their meetings, and achieved 73% lower cost per meeting. You don't have to replace your team — we can augment them. Your reps focus on warm conversations and closing while we fill the top of the funnel with 5,000+ touchpoints daily. Most clients who start as augmentation eventually shift more volume to us once they see the cost-per-meeting comparison.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Cold email is dead / doesn't work.">
    Generic cold email sent from shared infrastructure to untargeted lists is dead — and should be. Signal-based cold email with enterprise-grade deliverability is producing some of the strongest pipeline numbers in B2B. Alo Media Group hit a 31% reply rate and 35 meetings in 90 days. Ku Creatives booked 66 meetings in 7 months. PlantSwitch generated 330 meetings in 12 months. The difference is infrastructure (dedicated IPs, 100+ Outlook inboxes, SPF/DKIM/DMARC on every domain, 99% inbox placement), targeting (signal-based identification of prospects experiencing the problem you solve), and personalization (AI-powered references to real prospect data, not merge-tag mail merges). Cold email works when the execution is right. Most companies and agencies just don't have the infrastructure or data to execute it properly.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Your pricing is too high.">
    Compare the math. An in-house SDR costs $75K–$120K per year in salary alone, takes 3–6 months to ramp, averages 50–80 dials per day, and carries 50% annual turnover — every departure resets the cycle. You're also managing coaching, performance plans, sick days, and call reluctance. We deliver 10,000 dials per month, cold email across 100+ inboxes, and LinkedIn outreach as an integrated system — live in 14 days with zero ramp time, zero management overhead, and zero turnover risk. One client replaced two SDRs, tripled their meetings, and cut cost per meeting by 73%. The question isn't whether the price is high — it's what the cost per qualified meeting is compared to every alternative. Month-to-month contracts mean you can validate that comparison in 30 days with zero long-term risk.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="We need to think about it.">
    That's reasonable — this is a pipeline decision, not an impulse buy. Here's what we'd suggest: review the 44 published case studies on our [case studies page](/case-studies) and find clients in your industry or company size bracket. Look at the specific metrics — meetings booked, timelines, reply rates, ROI. Then book a second call where your account manager walks through exactly what a campaign would look like for your ICP, including targeting criteria, messaging angles, channel mix, and expected benchmarks. Month-to-month contracts with 10 business days' cancellation mean the downside of starting is one month. The downside of waiting is every month of pipeline you're not building. We've had clients who spent 3 months "thinking about it" tell us they wish they'd started on the first call.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I don't want to damage my brand with cold outreach.">
    Bad outbound damages brands. Untrained SDRs going off-script, pushing too hard, or calling the wrong person at the wrong time — that's what creates negative brand associations. Our system eliminates those risks. Every message across every channel is written by your account manager, approved by you with 100% script adherence, and AI-personalized to reference real prospect data. Cold calls follow DNC-scrubbed lists with time-zone compliance and clear caller identification. LinkedIn outreach references real prospect activity, not generic templates. Prospects consistently tell our clients they came to calls already warmed up because the outreach felt personal and credible. Outbound System delivers 5,000+ professional, consultative touchpoints daily that build awareness with your exact ICP — the opposite of the spray-and-pray approach that gives outbound a bad name.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="We're worried about LinkedIn account safety.">
    That concern is valid — most LinkedIn automation tools get accounts restricted because they use shared proxy pools, detectable browser environments, and static daily limits. Our infrastructure is fundamentally different at every layer. Each LinkedIn session runs inside an antidetect browser with a unique human-like fingerprint. Dedicated residential proxies provide consistent IP routing per profile. Activity follows human-like daily schedules with full offline periods. Adaptive limits recalculate based on real-time account health scoring. Accounts go through a calibrated warm-up protocol before volume scales. The system is specifically engineered to eliminate every signal LinkedIn's detection looks for: robotic timing, suspicious fingerprints, unusual login locations, and activity spikes. We've run thousands of LinkedIn campaigns without the account safety issues common with other providers. You can also run from dedicated accounts we provide if you prefer to keep your personal profile completely separate.
